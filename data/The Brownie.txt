Title: The Brownie

Summary:
None

Story Text:
The Scottish Brownie formed a class of being distinct in habit and  disposition from the freakish and mischievous elves.  He was meagre,  shaggy, and wild in his appearance.  Thus Cleland, in his satire  against the Highlanders, compares them to
“Faunes, or Brownies, if ye will,
              Or Satyres come from Atlas Hill.”
In the day-time he lurked in remote recesses of the old houses which  he delighted to haunt, and in the night sedulously employed himself  in discharging any laborious task which he thought might be acceptable  to the family to whose service he had devoted himself.  But the  Brownie does not drudge from the hope of recompense.  On the contrary,  so delicate is his attachment that the offer of reward, but particularly  of food, infallibly occasions his disappearance for ever.  It is  told of a Brownie, who haunted a border family now extinct, that the  lady having fallen unexpectedly ill, and the servant, who was ordered  to ride to Jedburgh for the sage-femme, showing no great alertness  in setting out, the  familiar spirit slipped on the greatcoat of the lingering domestic,  rode to the town on the laird’s best horse, and returned with  the midwife en croupe.  During the short space of his absence,  the Tweed, which they must necessarily ford, rose to a dangerous height.   Brownie, who transported his charge with all the rapidity of the ghostly  lover of Lenore, was not to be stopped by the obstacle.  He plunged  in with the terrified old lady, and landed her in safety where her services  were wanted.  Having put the horse into the stable (where it was  afterwards found in a woful plight), he proceeded to the room of the  servant, whose duty he had discharged, and finding him just in the act  of drawing on his boots, he administered to him a most merciless drubbing  with his own horsewhip.  Such an important service excited the  gratitude of the laird, who, understanding that Brownie had been heard  to express a wish to have a green coat, ordered a vestment of the colour  to be made, and left in his haunts.  Brownie took away the green  coat, but was never seen more.  We may suppose that, tired of his  domestic drudgery, he went in his new livery to join the fairies.
The last Brownie known in Ettrick Forest resided in Bodsbeck, a wild  and solitary spot, near the head of Moffat Water, where he exercised  his functions undisturbed, till the scrupulous devotion of an old lady  induced her to “hire him away,” as it was termed,  by placing in his haunt a porringer of milk and a piece of money.   After receiving this hint to depart, he was heard the whole night to  howl and cry, “Farewell to bonnie Bodsbeck!” which he was  compelled to abandon for ever.
