Story Text:
I
A peasant from Jursagard in the parish of  Hanger had gone to the forest the day before  Christmas, and started out for home late in the evening.  He had just about reached the Klintaberg  when he heard some one call out: "Tell the malt-swine  to come home, for her child has fallen into the  fire!" When the peasant reached home, there stood  his wife, who had been brewing the Yuletide ale,  and she was complaining that though she brewed and  brewed, it did not have the right flavor. Then he  told her what had been shouted at him from the hill,  and that very moment a troll-witch, whom they had  not noticed before, darted down from the stove and  made off in a great hurry. And when they looked  closer, they found that she had left behind a great  kettle full of the best malt, which she had gathered  during the brewing. And that was the reason the  poor woman had not been able to give her brew the  right flavor. The kettle was large, made of ornamented  metal, and was long preserved in Hanger.   It was at length sold at auction in 1838, and melted  down.
II
In former days, when a child came into the world,  his mother was known as a "heathen," until she  could take him to church to be christened. And it  was not safe for her to leave the house unless she  carried steel about her in some shape or form.  Now once there was one of these "heathen" women  in Norra Ryd, in the parish of Hanger, who prepared  lunch for the mowers, and went out and  called them in to eat. Then one of the mowers said  to her: "I cannot come, for my sheaf is not yet  bound." "I will bind it for you," said the woman.  The mowers went in and ate, but saw no more of  her. They went back into the field, and were about  to take up their work again, but still neither saw  nor heard her. They began to search, and hunted  for a number of days; but all in vain. Time passed,  till it was late in the fall. One day the weather was  clear and sunny. To this very day there is a cotter's hut,  called Kusabo, that stands on a hill  named Kusas, and the cotter who lived there went  to look for a horse. And there on the hillside he  saw the woman sitting who had disappeared, and  she was sewing. It was not far from Kusabo to  Norra Ryd, so he recognized her at once. He said   "O, you poor thing, and here you sit!" "Yes,"  said she, "but you must never mention it to Lars"—that  was her husband—"for I shall never return  from this place. Even now I am only allowed to sit  outside for a little while."
III
Once upon a time a girl was hunting for berries  on Kusabo mountain, and was taken into the hill.  But she wept, night and day, which disgruntled the  trolls, and they let her out again. But just as they  were letting her out, one of the trolls hit her such  a blow on the back that she was hump-backed for  the rest of her life. She herself used to tell how  she had been kept in the hill.
NOTE
Primitive faith and superstition are reflected in these three "Tales  of the Trolls" (communicated from mss. belonging to Dr. v. Sydow-Lund).  The first is also current in Norway; the others tell of women  who have been bergtagen, "taken into the mountain." It is not so  long since that every humped back, every weak mind, in short,  every ill that had no visible explanation, was ascribed to the  troll folk.
