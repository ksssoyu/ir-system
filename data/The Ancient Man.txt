Title: The Ancient Man

Summary:
None

Story Text:
Once upon a time there was a man named Huang  An. He must have been well over eighty and  yet he looked like a youth. He lived on cinnabar and  wore no clothing. Even in winter he went about  without garments. He sat on a tortoise three feet  long. Once he was asked: “About how old might this  tortoise be?” He answered: “When Fu Hi first invented  fish-nets and eel-pots he caught this tortoise  and gave it to me. And since then I have worn its  shield quite flat sitting on it. The creature dreads the  radiance of the sun and moon, so it only sticks its head  out of its shell once in two thousand years. Since I  have had the beast, it has already stuck its head out  five times.” With these words he took his tortoise on  his back and went off. And the legend arose that this  man was ten thousand years old.
Note: Cinnabar is frequently used in the preparation of the  elixir of life (comp. No. 30). Fu Hi is “the life-breeding breath.”  Tortoises live to a great age.
