Title: The Boy and the Dragon

Summary:
None

Story Text:
Once, long ago, before the white man came to Canada, a boy was living with his parents in a village near the ocean. As he had no brothers or sisters, he often felt lonely, but he was clever and full of curiosity. He longed for adventure and dreamed of discovering hidden treasures. One day, word spread that a great dragon had entered the land, devouring people and causing terror. Even worse, this dragon could disguise himself as a man of charming appearance, deceiving villages before striking. The Chief called for volunteers, but none dared challenge a creature so cunning and cruel.
The clever boy saw his chance. Trusting in a mysterious power he felt within himself, he said farewell to his parents and set off. After traveling inland, he climbed a high hill for a better view of the land. At the top, he met a kind-looking stranger who invited him to stay the night. The boy accepted, though he remained cautious. Outside the lodge, he noticed a heap of bleached bones—a silent warning. Inside, a bent old woman stirred meat stew in a pot. The boy, wary of the food, asked for corn instead.
Later, the old woman spoke to him privately. “That man is the dragon in disguise,” she whispered. “He cannot be killed by normal means. But I will help you, for you are young, pure-hearted, and clever.” She gave him enchanted moccasins and a birch bark inscribed with ancient signs. “These are treasures of great power,” she said. “In the morning, put on the moccasins. One step will take you to the next hill, where a guide awaits. Give him the birch bark. But remember, no matter how fast you travel, the dragon will find you by nightfall.” She also asked him to free her from the dragon’s spell by killing her and covering her body with a bright cloak, so she might rise again when the curse was lifted.
In the morning, while the dragon-man fetched water, the boy did as told. He stepped once with the magic moccasins and was instantly transported to a distant hill. There, another old man greeted him, exchanged his moccasins for a new pair, and gave him a second magical birch bark. This pattern continued until he reached the third guide, who gave him a maple leaf bearing a rare treasure-mark. “Enter the stream without fear,” the guide said, “and carry this bark with you—it will transform and protect you. It holds a treasure of shifting form.”
That evening, the boy, now in the form of a small red-finned fish thanks to the bark’s power, spotted the dragon in monstrous shape. When the dragon asked him about the boy, he replied, “No, sir. I have seen no one.” The dragon moved on, deceived. Other creatures—Toad, Turtle, Musk-rat—joined in tricking the dragon with clever lies. Finally, Turtle directed the dragon across the river, warning, “Fail to recognize your enemy, and you will die.” The dragon, now in snake form, slid into the current.
But the boy, still a fish and armed with the power of the treasure-bark, had created a hidden whirlpool. The snake, unaware, swam into the trap and was pulled under. The boy emerged victorious, returned to human form, retrieved the dragon’s head, and visited the lodge. The woman had vanished—free, at last. The boy went home, where he was honored with many gifts. The land knew peace again, and his cleverness and use of ancient treasures became legend. Yet even today, his people destroy snakes on sight, recalling how one had once masked the dragon that threatened them all.
