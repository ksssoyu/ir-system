Title: The Dracae

Summary:
None

Story Text:
These are a sort of water-spirits who inveigle women and children  into the recesses which they inhabit, beneath lakes and rivers, by floating  past them, on the surface of the water, in the shape of gold rings or  cups.  The women thus seized are employed as nurses, and after  seven years are permitted to revisit earth.  Gervase mentions one  woman in particular who had been allured by observing a wooden dish,  or cup, float by her, while she was washing clothes in the river.   Being seized as soon as she reached the depths, she was conducted into  one of the subterranean recesses, which she described as very magnificent,  and employed as nurse to one of the brood of the hag who had allured  her.  During her residence in this capacity, having accidentally  touched one of her eyes with an ointment of serpent’s grease,  she perceived, at her return to the world, that she had acquired the  faculty of seeing the Dracæ, when they intermingle themselves  with men.  Of this power she was, however, deprived by the touch  of her ghostly mistress, whom  she had one day incautiously addressed.  It is a curious fact that  this story, in almost all its parts, is current in both the Highlands  and Lowlands of Scotland, with no other variation than the substitution  of Fairies for Dracæ, and the cavern of a hill for that of a river.   Indeed many of the vulgar account it extremely dangerous to touch anything  which they may happen to find without saining (blessing) it, the snares  of the enemy being notorious and well-attested.  A pool-woman of  Teviotdale having been fortunate enough, as she thought herself, to  find a wooden beetle, at the very time when she needed such an implement,  seized it without pronouncing a proper blessing, and, carrying it home,  laid it above her bed to be ready for employment in the morning.   At midnight the window of her cottage opened, and a loud voice was heard  calling up some one within by a strange and uncouth name.  The  terrified cottager ejaculated a prayer, which, we may suppose, ensured  her personal safety; while the enchanted implement of housewifery, tumbling  from the bedstead, departed by the window with no small noise and precipitation.   In a humorous fugitive tract, Dr. Johnson has been introduced as disputing  the authenticity of an apparition, merely because the spirit assumed  the shape of a teapot and a shoulder of mutton.  No doubt, a case  so much in point as that we have now quoted would have removed his incredulity.
