None

Story Text:
Across the ocean, in Japan, there once lived curious creatures called  Onis. Every Japanese boy and girl has heard of them, though one has not  often been caught. In one museum, visitors could see the hairy leg of a  specimen. Falling out of the air in a storm, the imp had lost his limb.  It had been torn off by being caught in the timber side of a well curb.  The story-teller was earnestly assured by one Japanese lad that his  grandfather had seen it tumble from the clouds.
Many people are sure that the Onis live in the clouds and occasionally  fall off, during a peal of thunder. Then they escape and hide down in a  well. Or, they get loose in the kitchen, rattle the dishes around, and  make a great racket. They behave like cats, with a dog after them. They  do a great deal of mischief, but not much harm. There are even some old  folks who say that, after all, Onis are only unruly children, that  behave like angels in the morning and act like imps in the afternoon. So  we see that not much is known about the Onis.
Many things that go wrong are blamed on the Onis. Foolish folks, such as  stupid maid-servants, and dull-witted fellows, that blunder a good deal,  declare that the Onis made them do it. Drunken men, especially, that  stumble into mud-holes at night, say the Onis pushed them in. Naughty  boys that steal cake, and girls that take sugar, often tell fibs to  their parents, charging it on the Onis.
The Onis love to play jokes on people, but they are not dangerous. There  are plenty of pictures of them in Japan, though they never sat for their  portraits, but this is the way they looked.
Some Onis have only one eye in their forehead, others two, and, once in  a while, a big fellow has three. There are little, short horns on their  heads, but these are no bigger than those on a baby deer and never grow  long. The hair on their heads gets all snarled up, just like a little  girl's that cries when her tangled tresses are combed out; for the Onis  make use of neither brushes nor looking glasses. As for their faces,  they never wash them, so they look sooty. Their skin is rough, like an  elephant's. On each of their feet are only three toes. Whether an Oni  has a nose, or a snout, is not agreed upon by the learned men who have  studied them.
No one ever heard of an Oni being higher than a yardstick, but they are  so strong that one of them can easily lift two bushel bags of rice at  once. In Japan, they steal the food offered to the idols. They can live  without air. They like nothing better than to drink both the rice spirit  called saké, and the black liquid called soy, of which only a few drops,  as a sauce on fish, are enough for a man. Of this sauce, the Dutch, as  well as the Japanese, are very fond.
Above all things else, the most fun for a young Oni is to get into a  crockery shop. Once there, he jumps round among the cups and dishes,  hides in the jars, straddles the shelves and turns somersaults over the  counter. In fact, the Oni is only a jolly little imp. The Japanese  girls, on New Year's eve, throw handfuls of dried beans in every room of  the house and cry, "In, with good luck; and out with you, Onis!" Yet  they laugh merrily all the time. The Onis cannot speak, but they can  chatter like monkeys. They often seem to be talking to each other in  gibberish.
Now it once happened in Japan that the great Tycoon of the country  wanted to make a present to the Prince of the Dutch. So he sent all over  the land, from the sweet potato fields in the south to the seal and  salmon waters in the north, to get curiosities of all sorts. The  products of Japan, from the warm parts, where grow the indigo and the  sugar cane, to the cold regions, in which are the bear and walrus, were  sent as gifts to go to the Land of Dykes and Windmills. The Japanese had  heard that the Dutch people like cheese, walk in wooden shoes, eat with  forks, instead of chopsticks, and the women wear twenty petticoats  apiece, while the men sport jackets with two gold buttons, and folks  generally do things the other way from that which was common in Japan.
Now it chanced that while they were packing the things that were piled  up in the palace at Yedo, a young Oni, with his horns only half grown,  crawled into the kitchen, at night, through the big bamboo water pipe  near the pump. Pretty soon he jumped into the storeroom. There, the  precious cups, vases, lacquer boxes, pearl-inlaid pill-holders, writing  desks, jars of tea, and bales of silk, were lying about, ready to be put  into their cases. The yellow wrappings for covering the pretty things of  gold and silver, bronze and wood, and the rice chaff, for the packing of  the porcelain, were all at hand. What a jolly time the Oni did have, in  tumbling them about and rolling over them! Then he leaped like a monkey  from one vase to another. He put on a lady's gay silk kimono and wrapped  himself around with golden embroidery. Then he danced and played the  game of the Ka-gu'-ra, or Lion of Korea, pretending to make love to a  girl-Oni. Such funny capers as he did cut! It would have made a cat  laugh to see him. It was broad daylight, before his pranks were over,  and the Dutch church chimes were playing the hour of seven.
Suddenly the sound of keys in the lock told him that, in less than a  minute, the door would open.
Where should he hide? There was no time to be lost. So he seized some  bottles of soy from the kitchen shelf and then jumped into the big  bottom drawer of a ladies' cabinet, and pulled it shut.
"Namu Amida" (Holy Buddha!), cried the man that opened the door. "Who  has been here? It looks like a rat's picnic."
However, the workmen soon came and set everything to rights. Then they  packed up the pretty things. They hammered down the box lids and before  night the Japanese curiosities were all stored in the hold of a swift,  Dutch ship, from Nagasaki, bound for Rotterdam. After a long voyage, the  vessel arrived safely in good season, and the boxes were sent on to The  Hague, or capital city. As the presents were for the Prince, they were  taken at once to the pretty palace, called the House in the Wood. There  they were unpacked and set on exhibition for the Prince and Princess to  see the next day.
When the palace maid came in next morning to clean up the floor and dust  the various articles, her curiosity led her to pull open the drawer of  the ladies' cabinet; when out jumped something hairy. It nearly  frightened the girl out of her wits. It was the Oni, which rushed off  and down stairs, tumbling over a half dozen servants, who were sitting  at their breakfast. All started to run except the brave butler, who  caught up a carving knife and showed fight. Seeing this, the Oni ran  down into the cellar, hoping to find some hole or crevice for escape.  All around, were shelves filled with cheeses, jars of sour-krout,  pickled herring, and stacks of fresh rye bread standing in the corners.  But oh! how they did smell in his Japanese nostrils! Oni, as he was, he  nearly fainted, for no such odors had ever beaten upon his nose, when in  Japan. Even at the risk of being carved into bits, he must go back. So  up into the kitchen again he ran. Happily, the door into the garden  stood wide open.
Grabbing a fresh bottle of soy from the kitchen shelf, the Oni, with a  hop, skip and jump, reached outdoors. Seeing a pair of klomps, or wooden  shoes, near the steps, the Oni put his pair of three toes into them, to  keep the dogs from scenting its tracks. Then he ran into the fields,  hiding among the cows, until he heard men with pitchforks coming. At  once the Oni leaped upon a cow's back and held on to its horns, while  the poor animal ran for its life into its stall, in the cow stable,  hoping to brush the monster off.
The dairy farmer's wife was at that moment pulling open her bureau  drawer, to put on a new clean lace cap. Hearing her favorite cow moo and  bellow, she left the drawer open and ran to look through the pane of  glass in the kitchen. Through this, she could peep, at any minute, to  see whether this or that cow, or its calf, was sick or well.
Meanwhile, at the House in the Wood, the Princess, hearing the maid  scream and the servants in an uproar, rushed out in her embroidered  white nightie, to ask who, and what, and why, and wherefore. All  different and very funny were the answers of maid, butler, cook, valet  and boots.
The first maid, who had pulled open the drawer and let the Oni get out,  held up broom and duster, as if to take oath. She declared:
"It was a monkey, or baboon; but he seemed to talk—Russian, I think."
"No," said the butler. "I heard the creature—a black ram, running on  its hind legs; but its language was German, I'm sure."
The cook, a fat Dutch woman, told a long story. She declared, on honor,  that it was a black dog like a Chinese pug, that has no hair. However,  she had only seen its back, but she was positive the creature talked  English, for she heard it say "soy."
The valet honestly avowed that he was too scared to be certain of  anything, but was ready to swear that to his ears the words uttered  seemed to be Swedish. He had once heard sailors from Sweden talking, and  the chatter sounded like their lingo.
Then there was Boots, the errand boy, who believed that it was the  Devil; but, whatever or whoever it was, he was ready to bet a week's  wages that its lingo was all in French.
Now when the Princess found that not one of her servants could speak or  understand any language but their own, she scolded them roundly in  Dutch, and wound up by saying, "You're a lot of cheese-heads, all of  you."
Then she arranged the wonderful things from the Far East, with her own  dainty hands, until the House in the Wood was fragrant with Oriental  odors, and soon it became famous throughout all Europe. Even when her  grandchildren played with the pretty toys from the land of Fuji and  flowers, of silk and tea, cherry blossoms and camphor trees, it was not  only the first but the finest Japanese collection in all Europe.
Meanwhile, the Oni, in a strange land, got into one trouble after  another. In rushed men with clubs, but as an Oni was well used to seeing  these at home, he was not afraid. He could outrun, outjump, or outclimb  any man, easily. The farmer's vrouw (wife) nearly fainted when the Oni  leaped first into her room and then into her bureau drawer. As he did  so, the bottle of soy, held in his three-fingered paw, hit the wood and  the dark liquid, as black as tar, ran all over the nicely starched  laces, collars and nightcaps. Every bit of her quilled and crimped  hear-gear and neckwear, once as white as snow, was ruined.
"Donder en Bliksem" (thunder and lightning), cried the vrouw. "There's  my best cap, that cost twenty guilders, utterly ruined." Then she  bravely ran for the broomstick.
The Oni caught sight of what he thought was a big hole in the wall and  ran into it. Seeing the blue sky above, he began to climb up. Now there  were no chimneys in Japan and he did not know what this was. The soot  nearly blinded and choked him. So he slid down and rushed out, only to  have his head nearly cracked by the farmer's wife, who gave him a whack  of her broomstick. She thought it was a crazy goat that she was  fighting. She first drove the Oni into the cellar and then bolted the  door.
An hour later, the farmer got a gun and loaded it. Then, with his hired  man he came near, one to pull open the door, and the other to shoot.  What they expected to find was a monster.
But no! So much experience, even within an hour, of things unknown in  Japan, including chimneys, had been too severe for the poor, lonely,  homesick Oni. There it lay dead on the floor, with its three fingers  held tightly to its snout and closing it. So much cheese, zuur kool  (sour krout), gin (schnapps), advocaat (brandy and eggs), cows' milk,  both sour and fresh, wooden shoes, lace collars and crimped neckwear,  with the various smells, had turned both the Oni's head and his stomach.  The very sight of these strange things being so unusual, gave the Oni  first fright, and then a nervous attack, while the odors, such as had  never tortured his nose before, had finished him.
The wise men of the village were called together to hold an inquest.  After summoning witnesses, and cross-examining them and studying the  strange creature, their verdict was that it could be nothing less than a Hersen Schim, that is, a spectre of the brain. They meant by this  that there was no such animal.
However, a man from Delft, who followed the business of a knickerbocker,  or baker of knickers, or clay marles, begged the body of the Oni. He  wanted it to serve as a model for a new gargoyle, or rain spout, for the  roof of churches. Carved in stone, or baked in clay, which turns red and  is called terra cotta, the new style of monster became very popular. The  knickerbocker named it after a new devil, that had been expelled by the  prayers of the saints, and speedily made a fortune, by selling it to  stone cutters and architects. So for one real Oni, that died and was  buried in Dutch soil, there are thousands of imaginary ones, made of  baked clay, or stone, in the Dutch land, where things, more funny than  in fairy-land, constantly take place.
The dead Japanese Oni serving as a model, which was made into a water  gutter, served more useful purposes, for a thousand years, than ever he  had done, in the land where his relations still live and play their  pranks.
