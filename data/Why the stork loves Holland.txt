Story Text:
Above all countries in Europe, this bird, wise in the head and long in  the legs, loves Holland. Flying all the way from Africa, the stork is at  home among dykes and windmills.
Storks are seen by the thousands in Holland and Friesland. Sometimes  they strut in the streets, not in the least frightened or disturbed.  They make their nests among the tiles and chimneys, on the red roofs of  the houses, and they rear their young even on the church towers.
If a man sets an old cart wheel flat on a tree-top, the storks accept  this, as an invitation to come and stay. At once they proceed, first of  all, to arrange their toilet, after their long flight. They do this,  even before they build their nest. You can see them, by the hour,  preening their feathers and combing their plumage, with their long  bills. Then, as solemnly as a boss mason, they set about gathering  sticks and hay for their house. They never seem to be in a hurry.
A stork lays on a bit of wood, and then goes at his toilet again,  looking around to see that other folks are busy. Year after year, a pair  of storks will use the same nest, rebuilding, or repairing it, each  spring time. The stork is a steady citizen and does not like to change.  Once treated well in one place, by the landlord, Mr. and Mrs. Stork keep  the same apartments and watch over the family cradle inside the house,  to see that it is always occupied by a baby. The return of the stork is,  in Holland, a household celebration.
Out in the fields, Mr. Stork is happy indeed, for Holland is the  paradise of frogs; so the gentleman of the red legs finds plenty to eat.  He takes his time for going to dinner, and rarely rushes for quick  lunch. After business hours in the morning, he lays his long beak among  his thick breast feathers, until it is quite hidden. Then, perched up in  the air on one long leg, like a stilt, he takes a nap, often for hours.
With the other leg crossed, he seems to be resting on the figure four  (4).
Towards evening he shakes out his wings, flaps them once or twice, and  takes a walk, but he is never in haste. Beginning his hunt, he soon has  enough frogs, mice, grubs, worms or insects to make a good meal. It is  because this bird feels so much at home, in town and country, making  part of the landscape, that we so associate together Holland and the  stork, as we usually do.
The Dutch proverb pictures the scene, which is so common. "In the same  field, the cow eats grass; the grayhound hunts the hare; and the stork  helps himself to the frogs." Indeed, if it were not for the stork,  Holland would, like old Egypt, in the time of Moses, be overrun with  frogs.
The Dutch call the stork by the sweet name "Ooijevaar," or the  treasure-bringer. Every spring time, the boys and girls, fathers and  mothers, shout welcome to the white bird from Egypt.
"What do you bring me?" is their question or thought.
If the bird deserts its old home on their roof, the family is in grief,  thinking it has lost its luck; but if Daddy Stork, with Mrs. Stork's  approval, chooses a new place for their nest, there is more rejoicing in  that house, than if money had been found. "Where there are nestlings on  the roof, there will be babies in the house," is what the Dutch say; for  both are welcome.
To tell why the stork loves Holland, we must go back to the Africa of a  million years ago. Then, we shall ask the Dutch fairies how they  succeeded in making the new land, in the west, so popular in the stork  world. For what reason did the wise birds emigrate to the cold country a  thousand miles away? They were so regular and punctual, that a great  prophet wrote:
"Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times."
Ages ago, there were camels and caravans in Africa, but there was no  Holland, for the land was still under the waves. In India, also, the  stork was an old bird, that waded in the pools and kept the frogs from  croaking in terms of the multiplication table. Sometimes the stork  population increased too fast and some went hungry for food; for, the  proverb tells us that a stork "died while waiting for the ocean to dry,  hoping to get a supply of dried fish."
When on the coast of the North Sea, the Land of a Million Islands was  made, the frog emigrants were there first. They poured in so fast, that  it seemed a question as to who should own the country-frogs or men. Some  were very big, as if ambitious to be bulls. They croaked so loud, that  they drowned out the fairy music, and made the night hideous with their  noises. The snakes spoiled the country for the little birds, while the  toads seemed to think that the salt ocean had been kept out, and the  land made, especially for them.
The Dutch fairies were disgusted at the way these reptiles behaved, for  they could not enjoy themselves, as in the old days. If they went to  dance in the meadow, on moonlight nights, they always found a big  bullfrog sitting in their ring, mocking them with its bellowing. So when  they heard about the storks in Africa, and what hearty appetites they  had, for the various wrigglers, crawlers, jumpers and splashers in the  waters, they resolved to invite them, in a body, to Holland.
The Dutch fairies knew nothing of the habits of the bird and scarcely  imagined how such a creature might look, but they heard many pleasant  things about the stork's good character. The wise bird had an excellent  reputation, not only for being kind to its young, but also for attending  to the wants of its parents, when they were old. It was even said that  in some countries the stork was the symbol for filial piety.
So the fairies of all the Netherlands despatched a delegation to Egypt  and a congress of storks was called to consider this invitation to go  west. Messengers were at once sent to all the red-legged birds, among  the bulrushes of the Nile, or that lived on the roofs of the temples, or  that perched on the pyramids, or dwelt on the top of old columns, or  that stood in rows along the eaves of the town houses. The town birds  gained their living by acting as street cleaners, but the river birds  made their meals chiefly on fish, frogs, and mice.
The invitation was discussed in stork meeting, and it was unanimously  accepted; except by some old grannies and grandpops that feared in the  strange land they would not be well fed. On a second motion, it was  agreed that only the strongest birds should attempt the flight. Those  afraid, or too weak to go, must stay behind and attend to the old folks.  Such a rattle of mandibles was never heard in Egypt before, as when this  stork meeting adjourned.
Now when storks travel, they go in flocks. Thousands of them left Egypt  together. High in the air, with their broad wings spread and their long  legs stretched out behind them, they covered Europe in a few hours. Then  they scattered all over the marshy lands of the new country. It was  agreed that each pair was to find its own home. When the cold autumn  should come, they were to assemble again for flight to Egypt.
It was a new sight for the fairies, the frogs and the men, to look over  the landscape and see these snow white strangers. They were so pretty to  look at, while promenading over the meadows, wading in the ponds and  ditches, or standing silently by the river banks. Soon, however, these  foreign birds were very unpopular in bullfrog land, and as for the  snakes, they thought that Holland would be ruined by these hungry  strangers. On the other hand, it was good news, in fairy-land, that all  fairies could dance safely on their meadow rings, for the bullfrogs were  now afraid to venture in the grass, lest they should be gobbled up, for  the frogs could not hide from the storks. The new birds could poke their  big bills so far into the mud-holes, that no frog, or snake, big or  little, was safe. The stork's red legs were so long, and the birds could  wade in such deep water, that hundreds of frogs were soon eaten up, and  there were many widows and orphans in the ponds and puddles.
When the fairies got more acquainted with their new guests, and saw how  they behaved, they nearly died of laughing. They were not surprised at  their diet, or eating habits, but they soon discovered that the storks  were not song birds. Instead of having voices, they seemed to talk to  each other by clattering their long jaws, or snapping their mandibles  together. Their snowy plumage—all being white but their wing  feathers—was admired, was envied, and their long bright colored legs  were a wonder. At first the fairies thought their guests wore red  stockings and they thought how heavy must be the laundry work on wash  days; for in Holland, everything must be clean.
Of all creatures on earth, as the fairies thought, the funniest was seen  when Mr. Stork was in love. To attract and please his lady love, he made  the most grotesque gestures. He would leap up from the ground and move  with a hop, skip, and jump. Then he spread out his wings, as if to hug  his beloved. Then he danced around her, as if he were filled with wine.  All the time he made the best music he knew how, by clattering his  mandibles together. He intended this performance for a sort of love  ditty, or serenade. The whole program was more amusing than anything  that an ape, goat, or donkey could get up. How the fairies did laugh!
Yet the fairies were very grateful to the storks for ridding their  meadows of so much vermin. How these delicate looking, snow white and  graceful creatures could put so many snails, snakes, tadpoles, and toads  into their stomachs and turn them into snow white feathers, wonderful  wings and long legs, as red as a rose, was a mystery to them. It seemed  more wonderful than anything which they could do, but as fairies have no  stomachs and do not eat, this whole matter of digestion was a mystery to  them.
Besides the terror and gloom in the frog world, every reptile winced and  squirmed, when he heard of this new enemy. All crawlers, creepers, and  jumpers had so long imagined that the land was theirs and had been made  solely for their benefit! Nor did they know how to conquer the storks.  The frog daddies could do nothing, and the frog mothers were every  moment afraid to let either the tadpoles or froggies go out of their  sight. They worried lest they should see their babies caught up in a  pair of long, bony jaws, as sharp as scissors, there to wriggle and  crow, until their darlings disappeared within the monster.
One anecdote of the many that were long told in the old Dutch frog ponds  was this: showing into what clangers curiosity may lead youngsters. We  put it in quotation marks to show that it was told as a true story, and  not printed in a book, or made up.
"A tadpole often teased its froggy mother to let it go and see a red  pole, of which it had heard from a traveller. Mrs. Frog would not at  first let her son go, but promised that as soon as the tadpole lost his  tail, and his flippers had turned into fore legs, and his hind quarters  had properly sprouted, so that he could hop out of danger, he might then  venture on his travels. She warned him, however, not to go too near to  that curious red pole, of which he had heard. Nobody as yet found out  just what this red thing, standing in the water, was; but danger was  suspected by old heads, and all little froggies were warned to be  careful and keep away. In reality, the red stick was the leg of a stork,  sound asleep, for it was taking its usual afternoon nap. The frogs on  the bank, and those in the pool that held their noses above water, to  get their breath, had never before seen anything like this red stilt, or  its cross pole; for no bird of this sort had ever before flown into  their neighborhood. They never suspected that it was a stork, with its  legs shaped like the figure four (4). Indeed, they knew nothing of its  long bill, that could open and shut like a trap, catching a frog or  snake, and swallowing it in a moment.
"Unfortunately for this uneducated young frog, that had never travelled  from home, it now went too near the red pole, and, to show how brave it  was, rubbed its nose against the queer thing. Suddenly the horrible  creature, that had only been asleep, woke up and snapped its jaws. In a  moment, a wriggling froggy disappeared from sight into the stomach of a  monster, that had two red legs, instead of one. At the sight of such  gluttony, there was an awful splash, for a whole row of frogs had jumped  from the bank into the pool. After this, it was evident that Holland was  not to belong entirely to the frogs."
As for the human beings, they were so happy over the war with the vermin  and the victory of the storks, that they made this bird their pride and  joy. They heaped honors upon the stork as the savior of their country.  They placed boxes on the roofs of their houses for these birds to nest  in. All the old cart wheels in the land were hunted up. They sawed off  the willow trees a few feet above the ground, and set the wheels in  flat, which the storks used as their parlors and dressing rooms.
As for the knights, they placed the figure of the stork on their  shields, banners, and coats of arms, while citizens made this bird  prominent on their city seals. The capital of the country, The Hague,  was dedicated to this bird, and, for all time, a pond was dug within the  city limits, where storks were fed and cared for at the public expense.  Even to-day, many a good story, illustrating the tender affection of The  Hague storks for their young, is told and enjoyed as an example to Dutch  mothers to be the best in the world.
Out in the country at large, in any of the eleven provinces, whenever  they drained a swamp, or pumped out a pond to make a village, it was not  looked upon as a part of Holland, unless there were storks. Even in the  new wild places they planted stakes on the pumped out dry land, called  polders. On the top of these sticks were laid as invitations for the  stork families to come and live with the people. Along the roads they  stuck posts for storks' nests. It became a custom with farmers, when the  storks came back, to kill the fatted calf, or lamb, and leave the refuse  meat out in the fields for a feast to these bird visitors. A score of  Dutch proverbs exist, all of them complimentary to the bird that loves  babies and cradles.
Last of all, the Dutch children, even in the reign of Queen Wilhelmina,  made letter carriers of their friends the treasure-bringers. Tying tiny  slips of paper to their red legs, they sent messages, in autumn, to the  boys and girls in the old land of the sphinx and pyramids, of Moses, and  the children of Israel. In the spring time, the children's return  messages were received in the country which bids eternal welcome to the  bird named the Bringer of Blessings.
This is why the storks love Holland.
