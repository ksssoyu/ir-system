Summary:
None

Story Text:
Once upon a time there were two stars, sons of the  Golden King of the Heavens. The one was  named Tschen and the other Shen. One day they quarreled,  and Tschen struck Shen a terrible blow. Thereupon  both stars made a vow that they would never  again look upon each other. So Tschen only appears  in the evening, and Shen only appears in the morning,  and not until Tschen has disappeared is Shen again to  be seen. And that is why people say: “When two  brothers do not live peaceably with one another they  are like Tschen and Shen.”
Note: Tschen and Shen are Hesperus and Lucifer, the morning  and evening stars. The tale is told in its traditional form.
