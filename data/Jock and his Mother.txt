Story Text:
Ye see, there was a wife had a son, and they called him Jock; and  she said to him, “You are a lazy fellow; ye maun gang awa’  and do something for to help me.”  “Weel,” says  Jock, “I’ll do that.”  So awa’ he gangs,  and fa’s in wi’ a packman.  Says the packman, “If  you carry my pack a’ day, I’ll gie you a needle at night.”   So he carried the pack, and got the needle; and as he was gaun awa’  hame to his mither, he cuts a burden o’ brackens, and put the  needle into the heart o’ them.  Awa’ he gaes hame.   Says his mither, “What hae ye made o’ yoursel’ the  day?”  Says Jock, “I fell in wi’ a packman, and  carried his pack a’ day, and he gae me a needle for’t, and  ye may look for it amang the brackens.”  “Hout,”  quo’ she, “ye daft gowk, you should hae stuck it into your  bonnet, man.”  “I’ll mind that again,”  quo’ Jock.
Next day he fell in wi’ a man carrying plough socks.   “If ye help me to carry my socks a’ day, I’ll gie  ye ane to yersel’ at night.”  “I’ll do  that,” quo’ Jock.  Jock carried them a’ day,  and got a sock, which  he stuck in his bonnet.  On the way hame, Jock was dry, and gaed  away to take a drink out o’ the burn; and wi’ the weight  o’ the sock, his bonnet fell into the river, and gaed out o’  sight.  He gaed hame, and his mither says, “Weel, Jock, what  hae you been doing a’ day?”  And then he tells her.   “Hout,” quo’ she, “you should hae tied the string  to it, and trailed it behind you.”  “Weel,” quo’  Jock, “I’ll mind that again.”
Awa’ he sets, and he fa’s in wi’ a flesher.   “Weel,” says the flesher, “if ye’ll be my servant  a’ day, I’ll gie ye a leg o’ mutton at night.”   “I’ll be that,” quo’ Jock.  He got a leg  o’ mutton at night.  He ties a string to it, and trails it  behind him the hale road hame.  “What hae ye been doing?”  said his mither.  He tells her.  “Hout, you fool, ye  should hae carried it on your shouther.”  “I’ll  mind that again,” quo’ Jock.
Awa’ he gaes next day, and meets a horse-dealer.  He says,  “If you will help me wi’ my horses a’ day, I’ll  give you ane to yoursel’ at night.”  “I’ll  do that,” quo’ Jock.  So he served him, and got his  horse, and he ties its feet; but as he was not able to carry it on his  back, he left it lying on the roadside.  Hame he comes, and tells  his mither.  “Hout, ye daft gowk, ye’ll ne’er  turn wise!  Could ye no hae loupen on it, and ridden it?”   “I’ll mind that again,” quo’ Jock.
Aweel, there was a grand gentleman, wha had a daughter  wha was very subject to melancholy; and her father gae out that whaever  should mak’ her laugh would get her in marriage.  So it happened  that she was sitting at the window ae day, musing in her melancholy  state, when Jock, according to the advice o’ his mither, cam’  flying up on a cow’s back, wi’ the tail over his shouther.   And she burst out into a fit o’ laughter.  When they made  inquiry wha made her laugh, it was found to be Jock riding on the cow.   Accordingly, Jock was sent for to get his bride.  Weel, Jock was  married to her, and there was a great supper prepared.  Amongst  the rest o’ the things, there was some honey, which Jock was very  fond o’.  After supper, they all retired, and the auld priest  that married them sat up a’ night by the kitchen fireside.   So Jock waukens in the night-time, and says, “Oh, wad ye gie me  some o’ yon nice sweet honey that we got to our supper last night?”   “Oh ay,” says his wife, “rise and gang into the press,  and ye’ll get a pig fou o ’t.”  Jock rose, and  thrust his hand into the honey-pig for a nievefu’ o ’t,  and he could not get it out.  So he cam’ awa’ wi’  the pig in his hand, like a mason’s mell, and says, “Oh,  I canna get my hand out.”  “Hoot,” quo’  she, “gang awa’ and break it on the cheek-stane.”   By this time, the fire was dark, and the auld priest was lying snoring  wi’ his head against the chimney-piece, wi’ a huge white  wig on.  Jock gaes awa’, and gae him a whack wi’ the  honey-pig on the head,  thinking it was the cheek-stane, and knocks it a’ in bits.   The auld priest roars out, “Murder!”  Jock tak’s  doun the stair as hard as he could bicker, and hides himsel’ amang  the bees’ skeps.
That night, as luck wad have it, some thieves cam’ to steal  the bees’ skeps, and in the hurry o’ tumbling them into  a large grey plaid, they tumbled Jock in alang wi’ them.   So aff they set, wi’ Jock and the skeps on their backs.   On the way, they had to cross the burn where Jock lost his bonnet.   Ane o’ the thieves cries, “Oh, I hae fand a bonnet!”  and Jock, on hearing that, cries out, “Oh, that’s mine!”   They thocht they had got the deil on their backs.  So they let  a’ fa’ in the burn; and Jock, being tied in the plaid, couldna  get out; so he and the bees were a’ drowned thegither.
If a’ tales be true, that’s nae lee.
