Story Text:
In the Skalunda mountain, near the church, there  once lived a giant in the early days, who no  longer felt comfortable after the church had been  built there. At length he decided that he could no  longer stand the ringing of the church bells; so he  emigrated and settled down on an island far out in  the North Sea. Once upon a time a ship was  wrecked on this island, and among those saved were  several people from Skalunda.
"Whence do you hail?" asked the giant, who  by now had grown old and blind, and sat warming  himself before a log fire.
"We are from Skalunda, if you wish to know,"  said one of the men saved.
"Give me your hand, so that I may feel whether  there is still warm blood to be found in the Swedish  land," said the giant.
The man, who feared to shake hands with the  giant, drew a red-hot bar of iron from the fire  and handed it to him. He seized it firmly, and  pressed it so hard that the molten iron ran down  between his fingers.
"Yes, there is still warm blood to be found in  Sweden," said he. "And tell me," he continued,  "is Skalunda mountain still standing?"
"No, the hens have scratched it away," the man  answered.
"How could it last?" said the giant. "My wife  and daughter piled it up in the course of a single  Sunday morning. But surely the Hallenberg and  the Hunneberg are still standing, for those I built  myself."
When the man had confirmed this, the giant  wanted to know whether Karin was still living in  Stommen. And when they told him that she was,  he gave them a girdle, and with it the message that  Karin was to wear it in remembrance of him.
The men took the girdle and gave it to Karin upon  their return home; but before Karin put it on, she  clasped it around the oak-tree that grew in the  court. No sooner had she done so than the oak tore  itself out of the ground, and flew to the North,  borne away by the storm-wind. In the place  where it had stood was a deep pit, and the roots of  the tree were so enormous that one of the best  springs in Stommen flows from one of the root-holes  to this very day.
NOTE
"The Skalunda Giant" (Hofberg, Svenska Folksagner, Stockholm,  1882, p. 98) has a near relative in the Norwegian mountain giant  of Mesingeberg, of whom Asbj√∂rnsen tells.
