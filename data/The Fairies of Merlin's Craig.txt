Story Text:
Early in the seventeenth century, John Smith, a barn-man at a farm,  was sent by his master to cast divots (turf) on the green immediately  behind Merlin’s Craig.  After having laboured for a considerable  time, there came round from the front of the rock a little woman, about  eighteen inches in height, clad in a green gown and red stockings, with  long yellow hair hanging down to her waist, who asked the astonished  operator how he would feel were she to send her husband to tir (uncover) his house, at the same time commanding him to place every divot he had cast in statu quo.  John obeyed with  fear and trembling, and, returning to his master, told what had happened.   The farmer laughed at his credulity, and, anxious to cure him of such  idle superstition, ordered him to take a cart and fetch home the divots immediately.
John obeyed, although with much reluctance.  Nothing happened  to him in consequence till that day twelve months, when he left his  master’s work at the usual hour in the evening, with a small stoup of milk in his hand,  but he did not reach home, nor was he ever heard of for years (I have  forgotten how many), when, upon the anniversary of that unfortunate  day, John walked into his house at the usual hour, with the milk-stoup  in his hand.
The account that he gave of his captivity was that, on the evening  of that eventful day, returning home from his labour, when passing Merlin’s  Craig, he felt himself suddenly taken ill, and sat down to rest a little.   Soon after he fell asleep, and awoke, as he supposed, about midnight,  when there was a troop of male and female fairies dancing round him.   They insisted upon his joining in the sport, and gave him the finest  girl in the company as a partner.  She took him by the hand; they  danced three times round in a fairy ring, after which he became so happy  that he felt no inclination to leave his new associates.  Their  amusements were protracted till he heard his master’s cock crow,  when the whole troop immediately rushed forward to the front of the  craig, hurrying him along with them.  A door opened to receive  them, and he continued a prisoner until the evening on which he returned,  when the same woman who had first appeared to him when casting divots came and told him that the grass was again green on the roof of her  house, which he had tirred, and if he would swear an oath, which  she dictated, never to discover what he had seen in fairyland, he should  be at liberty to return to his family.  John  took the oath, and observed it most religiously, although sadly teased  and questioned by his helpmate, particularly about the “bonnie  lassie” with whom he danced on the night of his departure.   He was also observed to walk a mile out of his way rather than pass  Merlin’s Craig when the sun was below the horizon.
On a subsequent occasion the tiny inhabitants of Merlin’s Craig  surprised a shepherd when watching his fold at night; he was asleep,  and his bonnet had fallen off and rolled to some little distance.   He was awakened by the fairies dancing round him in a circle, and was  induced to join them; but recollecting the fate of John Smith, he would  not allow his female companion to take hold of his hands.  In the  midst of their gambols they came close to the hillock where the shepherd’s  bonnet lay,—he affected to stumble, fell upon his bonnet, which  he immediately seized, clapping it on his head, when the whole troop  instantly vanished.  This exorcism was produced by the talismanic  power of a Catechism containing the Lord’s Prayer and the Apostles’  Creed, which the shepherd most fortunately recollected was deposited  in the crown of his bonnet.
