Story Text:
The elves are the little white creatures that live between heaven and  earth. They are not in the clouds, nor down in the caves and mines, like  the kabouters. They are bright and fair, dwelling in the air, and in the  world of light. The direct heat of the sun is usually too much for them,  so they are not often seen during the day, except towards sunset. They  love the silvery moonlight. There used to be many folks, who thought  they had seen the beautiful creatures, full of fun and joy, dancing hand  in hand, in a circle.
In these old days, long since gone by, there were more people than there  are now, who were sure they had many times enjoyed the sight of the  elves. Some places in Holland show, by their names, where this kind of  fairies used to live. These little creatures, that looked as thin as  gauze, were very lively and mischievous, though they often helped honest  and hard working people in their tasks, as we shall see. But first and  most of all, they were fond of fun. They loved to vex cross people and  to please those who were bonnie and blithe. They hated misers, but they  loved the kind and generous. These little folks usually took their  pleasure in the grassy meadows, among the flowers and butterflies. On  bright nights they played among the moonbeams.
There were certain times when the elves were busy, in such a way as to  make men and girls think about them. Then their tricks were generally in  the stable, or in the field among the cows. Sometimes, in the kitchen or  dairy, among the dishes or milk-pans, they made an awful mess for the  maids to clean up. They tumbled over the churns, upset the milk jugs,  and played hoops with the round cheeses. In a bedroom they made things  look as if the pigs had run over them.
When a farmer found his horse's mane twisted into knots, or two cows  with their tails tied together, he said at once, "That's the work of  elves." If the mares did not feel well, or looked untidy, their owners  were sure the elves had taken the animals out and had been riding them  all night. If a cow was sick, or fell down on the grass, it was believed  that the elves had shot an arrow into its body. The inquest, held on  many a dead calf or its mother, was, that it died from an "elf-shot."  They were so sure of this, that even when a stone arrow head—such as  our far-off ancestors used in hunting, when they were cave men—was  picked up off the ground, it was called an "elf bolt," or "elf-arrow."
Near a certain village named Elf-berg or Elf Hill, because there were so  many of the little people in that neighborhood, there was one very old  elf, named Styf, which means Stiff, because though so old he stood up  straight as a lance. Even more than the young elves, he was famous for  his pranks. Sometimes he was nicknamed Haan-e'-kam or Cock's Comb. He  got this name, because he loved to mock the roosters, when they crowed,  early in the morning. With his red cap on, he did look like a rooster.  Sometimes he fooled the hens, that heard him crowing. Old Styf loved  nothing better than to go to a house where was a party indoors. All the  wooden shoes of the twenty or thirty people within, men and women, girls  and boys, would be left outside the door. All good Dutch folks step out  of their heavy timber shoes, or klomps, before they enter a house. It is  always a curious sight, at a country church, or gathering of people at a  party, to see the klomps, big and little, belonging to baby boys and  girls, and to the big men, who wear a number thirteen shoe of wood. One  wonders how each one of the owners knows his own, but he does. Each pair  is put in its own place, but Old Styf would come and mix them all up  together, and then leave them in a pile. So when the people came out to  go home, they had a terrible time in finding and sorting out their  shoes. Often they scolded each other; or, some innocent boy was blamed  for the mischief. Some did not find out, till the next day, that they  had on one foot their own, and on another foot, their neighbor's shoe.  It usually took a week to get the klomps sorted out, exchanged, and the  proper feet into the right shoes. In this way, which was a special trick  with him, this naughty elf, Styf, spoiled the temper of many people.
Beside the meadow elves, there were other kinds in Elfin Land; some  living in the woods, some in the sand-dunes, but those called  Staalkaars, or elves of the stall, were Old Styf's particular friends.  These lived in stables and among the cows. The Moss Maidens, that could  do anything with leaves, even turning them into money, helped Styf, for  they too liked mischief. They teased men-folks, and enjoyed nothing  better than misleading the stupid fellows that fuddled their brains with  too much liquor.
Styf's especially famous trick was played on misers. It was this. When  he heard of any old fellow, who wanted to save the cost of candles, he  would get a kabouter to lead him off in the swamps, where the sooty  elves come out, on dark nights, to dance. Hoping to catch these lights  and use them for candles, the mean fellow would find himself in a swamp,  full of water and chilled to the marrow. Then the kabouters would laugh  loudly.
Old Styf had the most fun with another stingy fellow, who always scolded  children when he found them spending a penny. If he saw a girl buying  flowers, or a boy giving a copper coin for a waffle, he talked roughly  to them for wasting money. Meeting this miser one day, as he was walking  along the brick road, leading from the village, Styf offered to pay the  old man a thousand guilders, in exchange for four striped tulips, that  grew in his garden. The miser, thinking it real silver, eagerly took the  money and put it away in his iron strong box. The next night, when he  went, as he did three times a week, to count, and feel, and rub, and  gloat, over his cash, there was nothing but leaves in a round form.  These, at his touch, crumbled to pieces. The Moss Maidens laughed  uproariously, when the mean old fellow was mad about it.
But let no one suppose that the elves, because they were smarter than  stupid human beings, were always in mischief. No, no! They did, indeed,  have far more intelligence than dull grown folks, lazy boys, or careless  girls; but many good things they did. They sewed shoes for poor  cobblers, when they were sick, and made clothes for children, when the  mother was tired. When they were around, the butter came quick in the  churn.
When the blue flower of the flax bloomed in Holland, the earth, in  spring time, seemed like the sky. Old Styf then saw his opportunity to  do a good thing. Men thought it a great affair to have even coarse linen  tow for clothes. No longer need they hunt the wolf and deer in the  forest, for their garments. By degrees, they learned to make finer  stuff, both linen for clothes and sails for ships, and this fabric they  spread out on the grass until the cloth was well bleached. When taken  up, it was white as the summer clouds that sailed in the blue sky. All  the world admired the product, and soon the word "Holland" was less the  name of a country, than of a dainty fabric, so snow white, that it was  fit to robe a queen. The world wanted more and more of it, and the Dutch  linen weaver grew rich. Yet still there was more to come.
Now, on one moonlight night in summer, the lady elves, beautiful  creatures, dressed in gauze and film, with wings to fly and with feet  that made no sound, came down into the meadows for their fairy dances.  But when, instead of green grass, they saw a white landscape, they  wondered, Was it winter?
Surely not, for the air was warm. No one shivered, or was cold. Yet  there were whole acres as white as snow, while all the old fairy rings,  grass and flowers were hidden.
They found that the meadows had become bleaching grounds, so that the  cows had to go elsewhere to get their dinner, and that this white area  was all linen. However, they quickly got over their surprise, for elves  are very quick to notice things. But now that men had stolen a march on  them, they asked whether, after all, these human beings had more  intelligence than elves. Not one of these fairies but believed that men  and women were the inferiors of elves.
So, then and there, began a battle of wits.
"They have spoiled our dancing floor with their new invention; so we  shall have to find another," said the elfin queen, who led the party.
"They are very proud of their linen, these men are; but, without the  spider to teach them, what could they have done? Even a wild boar can  instruct these human beings. Let us show them, that we, also, can do  even more. I'll get Old Styf to put on his thinking cap. He'll add  something new that will make them prouder yet."
"But we shall get the glory of it," the elves shouted in chorus. Then  they left off talking and began their dances, floating in the air, until  they looked, from a distance, like a wreath of stars.
The next day, a procession of lovely elf maidens and mothers waited on  Styf and asked him to devise something that would excel the invention of  linen; which, after all, men had learned from the spider.
"Yes, and they would not have any grain fields, if they had not learned  from the wild boar," added the elf queen.
Old Styf answered "yes" at once to their request, and put on his red  thinking cap. Then some of the girl elves giggled, for they saw that he  did, really, look like a cock's comb. "No wonder they called him  Haan-e'-kam," said one elf girl to the other.
Now Old Styf enjoyed fooling, just for the fun of it, and he taught all  the younger elves that those who did the most work with their hands and  head, would have the most fun when they were old.
First of all, he went at once to see Fro, the spirit of the golden  sunshine and the warm summer showers, who owned two of the most  wonderful things in the world. One was his sword, which, as soon as it  was drawn out of its sheath, against wicked enemies, fought of its own  accord and won every battle. Fro's chief enemies were the frost giants,  who wilted the flowers and blasted the plants useful to man. Fro was  absent, when Styf came, but his wife promised he would come next day,  which he did. He was happy to meet all the elves and fairies, and they,  in turn, joyfully did whatever he told them. Fro knew all the secrets of  the grain fields, for he could see what was in every kernel of both the  stalks and the ripe ears. He arrived, in a golden chariot, drawn by his  wild boar which served him instead of a horse. Both chariot and boar  drove over the tops of the ears of wheat, and faster than the wind.
The Boar was named Gullin, or Golden Bristles because of its sunshiny  color and splendor. In this chariot, Fro had specimens of all the  grains, fruits, and vegetables known to man, from which Styf could  choose, for these he was accustomed to scatter over the earth.
When Styf told him just what he wanted to do, Fro picked out a sheaf of  wheat and whispered a secret in his ear. Then he drove away, in a burst  of golden glory, which dazzled even the elves, that loved the bright  sunshine. These elves were always glad to see the golden chariot coming  or passing by.
Styf also summoned to his aid the kabouters, and, from these ugly little  fellows, got some useful hints; for they, dwelling in the dark caverns,  know many secrets which men used to name alchemy, and which they now  call chemistry.
Then Styf fenced himself off from all intruders, on the top of a bright,  sunny hilltop, with his thinking cap on and made experiments for seven  days. No elves, except his servants, were allowed to see him. At the end  of a week, still keeping his secret and having instructed a dozen or so  of the elf girls in his new art, he invited all the elves in the Low  Countries to come to a great exhibition, which he intended to give.
What a funny show it was! On one long bench, were half a dozen washtubs;  and on a table, near by, were a dozen more washtubs; and on a longer  table not far away were six ironing boards, with smoothing irons. A  stove, made hot with a peat fire, was to heat the irons. Behind the tubs  and tables, stood the twelve elf maidens, all arrayed in shining white  garments and caps, as spotless as snow. One might almost think they were  white elves of the meadow and not kabouters of the mines. The wonder was  that their linen clothes were not only as dainty as stars, but that they  glistened, as if they had laid on the ground during a hoar frost.
Yet it was still warm summer. Nothing had frozen, or melted, and the  rosy-faced elf-maidens were as dry as an ivory fan. Yet they resembled  the lilies of the garden when pearly with dew-drops.
When all were gathered together, Old Styf called for some of the  company, who had come from afar, to take off their dusty and  travel-stained linen garments and give them to him. These were passed  over to the trained girls waiting to receive them. In a jiffy, they were  washed, wrung out, rinsed and dried. It was noticed that those  elf-maidens, who were standing at the last tub, were intently expecting  to do something great, while those five elf maids at the table took off  the hot irons from the stove. They touched the bottom of the flat-irons  with a drop of water to see if it rolled off hissing. They kept their  eyes fixed on Styf, who now came forward before all and said, in a loud  voice:
"Elves and fairies, moss maidens and stall sprites, one and all, behold  our invention, which our great friend Fro and our no less helpful  friends, the kabouters, have helped me to produce. Now watch me prove  its virtues."
Forthwith he produced before all a glistening substance, partly in  powder, and partly in square lumps, as white as chalk. He easily broke  up a handful under his fingers, and flung it into the fifth tub, which  had hot water in it. After dipping the washed garments in the white  gummy mass, he took them up, wrung them out, dried them with his breath,  and then handed them to the elf ironers. In a few moments, these held  up, before the company, what a few minutes before had been only dusty  and stained clothes. Now, they were white and resplendent. No fuller's  earth could have bleached them thus, nor added so glistening a surface.
It was starch, a new thing for clothes. The fairies, one and all,  clapped their hands in delight.
"What shall we name it?" modestly asked Styf of the oldest gnome  present.
"Hereafter, we shall call you Styf Sterk, Stiff Starch." They all  laughed.
Very quickly did the Dutch folks, men and women, hear and make use of  the elves' invention. Their linen closets now looked like piles of snow.  All over the Low Countries, women made caps, in new fashions, of lace or  plain linen, with horns and wings, flaps and crimps, with quilling and  with whirligigs. Soon, in every town, one could read the sign "Hier  mangled men" (Here we do ironing).
In time, kings, queens and nobles made huge ruffs, often so big that  their necks were invisible, and their heads nearly lost from sight, in  rings of quilled linen, or of lace, that stuck out a foot or so. Worldly  people dyed their starch yellow; zealous folk made it blue; but moderate  people kept it snowy white.
Starch added money and riches to the nation. Kings' treasuries became  fat with money gained by taxes laid on ruffs, and on the cargoes of  starch, which was now imported by the shipload, or made on the spot, in  many countries. So, out of the ancient grain came a new spirit that  worked for sweetness and beauty, cleanliness, and health. From a useful  substance, as old as Egypt, was born a fine art, that added to the sum  of the world's wealth and pleasure.
