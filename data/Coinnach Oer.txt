Story Text:
Coinnach Oer, which means Dun Kenneth, was a celebrated man in his  generation.  He has been called the Isaiah of the North.   The prophecies of this man are very frequently alluded to and quoted  in various parts of the Highlands; although little is known of the man  himself, except in Ross-shire.  He was a small farmer in Strathpeffer,  near Dingwall, and for many years of his life neither exhibited any  talents, nor claimed any intelligence above his fellows.  The manner  in which he obtained the prophetic gift was told by himself in the following  manner:—
As he was one day at work in the hill casting (digging) peats, he  heard a voice which seemed to call to him out of the air.  It commanded  him to dig under a little green knoll which was near, and to gather  up the small white stones which he would discover beneath the turf.   The voice informed him, at the same time, that while he kept these stones  in his possession, he should be endued with the power of supernatural  foreknowledge.
Kenneth, though greatly  alarmed at this aerial conversation, followed the directions of his  invisible instructor, and turning up the turf on the hillock, in a little  time discovered the talismans.  From that day forward, the mind  of Kenneth was illuminated by gleams of unearthly light; and he made  many predictions, of which the credulity of the people, and the coincidence  of accident, often supplied confirmation; and he certainly became the  most notable of the Highland prophets.  The most remarkable and  well known of his vaticinations is the following:—“Whenever  a M’Lean with long hands, a Fraser with a black spot on his face,  a M’Gregor with a black knee, and a club-footed M’Leod of  Raga, shall have existed; whenever there shall have been successively  three M’Donalds of the name of John, and three M’Kinnons  of the same Christian name,—oppressors will appear in the country,  and the people will change their own land for a strange one.”   All these personages have appeared since; and it is the common opinion  of the peasantry, that the consummation of the prophecy was fulfilled,  when the exaction of the exorbitant rents reduced the Highlanders to  poverty, and the introduction of the sheep banished the people to America.
Whatever might have been the gift of Kenneth Oer, he does not appear  to have used it with an extraordinary degree of discretion; and the  last time he exercised  it, he was very near paying dear for his divination.
On this occasion he happened to be at some high festival of the M’Kenzies  at Castle Braan.  One of the guests was so exhilarated by the scene  of gaiety, that he could not forbear an eulogium on the gallantry of  the feast, and the nobleness of the guests.  Kenneth, it appears,  had no regard for the M’Kenzies, and was so provoked by this sally  in their praise, that he not only broke out into a severe satire against  their whole race, but gave vent to the prophetic denunciation of wrath  and confusion upon their posterity.  The guests being informed  (or having overheard a part) of this rhapsody, instantly rose up with  one accord to punish the contumely of the prophet.  Kenneth, though  he foretold the fate of others, did not in any manner look into that  of himself; for this reason, being doubtful of debating the propriety  of his prediction upon such unequal terms, he fled with the greatest  precipitation.  The M’Kenzies followed with infinite zeal;  and more than one ball had whistled over the head of the seer before  he reached Loch Ousie.  The consequences of this prediction so  disgusted Kenneth with any further exercise of his prophetic calling,  that, in the anguish of his flight, he solemnly renounced all communication  with its power; and, as he ran along the margin of Loch Ousie, he took  out the wonderful pebbles, and cast them in a fury into  the water.  Whether his evil genius had now forsaken him, or his  condition was better than that of his pursuers, is unknown, but certain  it is, Kenneth, after the sacrifice of the pebbles, outstripped his  enraged enemies, and never, so far as I have heard, made any attempt  at prophecy from the hour of his escape.
Kenneth Oer had a son, who was called Ian Dubh Mac Coinnach (Black  John, the son of Kenneth), and lived in the village of Miltoun, near  Dingwall.  His chief occupation was brewing whisky; and he was  killed in a fray at Miltoun, early in the present century.  His  exit would not have formed the catastrophe of an epic poem, and appears  to have been one of those events of which his father had no intelligence,  for it happened in the following manner:—
Having fallen into a dispute with a man with whom he had previously  been on friendly terms, they proceeded to blows; in the scuffle, the  boy, the son of Ian’s adversary, observing the two combatants  locked in a close and firm gripe of eager contention, and being doubtful  of the event, ran into the house and brought out the iron pot-crook,  with which he saluted the head of the unfortunate Ian so severely, that  he not only relinquished his combat, but departed this life on the ensuing  morning.
