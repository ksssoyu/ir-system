Title: The Poor Devil

Summary:
None

Story Text:
Once upon a time there was a peasant, who led  his cow to pasture in the spring, and prayed  God to have her in His care.
The evil one was sitting in a bush, heard him, and  said to himself: "When things turn out well, they  thank God for it; but if anything goes wrong, then  I am always to blame!"
A few days later the cow strayed into a swamp.  And when the peasant came and saw her he said:  "Look at that! The devil has had his finger in the  pie again!"
"Just what I might have expected," thought the  devil in his bush. Then the peasant went off to  fetch people to help drag the cow out. But in the  meantime the devil slipped from his bush and helped  out the cow, for he thought:
"Now he will have something to thank me for,  too."
But when the peasant came back and saw the  cow on dry land, he said: "Thank God, she's out  again!"
NOTE
The little story of "The Poor Devil." (Bondeson, p. 212. From  Smaland) which shows him attempting to rival God, is at once  humorous and philosophical.
