“Though my  mind’s not
              Hoodwinked with rustic marvels, I do think
              There are more things in the grove, the air, the flood,
              Yea, and the charnelled earth, than what wise man,
              Who walks so proud as if his form alone
              Filled the wide temple of the universe,
              Will let a frail mind say.  I’d write i’ the creed
              O’ the sagest head alive, that fearful forms,
              Holy or reprobate, do page men’s heels;
              That shapes, too horrid for our gaze, stand o’er
              The murderer’s dust, and for revenge glare up,
              Even till the stars weep fire for very pity.”
Along the sea of Solway, romantic on the Scottish side, with its  woodland, its bays, its cliffs, and headlands; and interesting on the  English side, with its many beautiful towns with their shadows on the  water, rich pastures, safe harbours, and numerous ships, there still  linger many traditional stories of a maritime nature, most of them connected  with superstitions singularly wild and unusual.  To the curious  these tales afford a rich fund of entertainment, from the many diversities  of the same story; some dry and barren, and stripped of all the embellishments  of poetry; others dressed out in all the riches  of a superstitious belief and haunted imagination.  In this they  resemble the inland traditions of the peasants; but many of the oral  treasures of the Galwegian or the Cumbrian coast have the stamp of the  Dane and the Norseman upon them, and claim but a remote or faint affinity  with the legitimate legends of Caledonia.  Something like a rude  prosaic outline of several of the most noted of the northern ballads,  the adventures and depredations of the old ocean kings, still lends  life to the evening tale; and, among others, the story of the Haunted  Ships is still popular among the maritime peasantry.
One fine harvest evening I went on board the shallop of Richard Faulder,  of Allanbay, and, committing ourselves to the waters, we allowed a gentle  wind from the east to waft us at its pleasure towards the Scottish coast.   We passed the sharp promontory of Siddick, and, skirting the land within  a stonecast, glided along the shore till we came within sight of the  ruined Abbey of Sweetheart.  The green mountain of Criffel ascended  beside us; and the bleat of the flocks from its summit, together with  the winding of the evening horn of the reapers, came softened into something  like music over land and sea.  We pushed our shallop into a deep  and wooded bay, and sat silently looking on the serene beauty of the  place.  The moon glimmered in her rising through the tall shafts  of the pines of Caerlaverock; and the sky, with scarce a cloud, showered  down on wood and headland and bay the twinkling beams of a thousand  stars, rendering every object visible.  The tide, too, was coming  with that swift and silent swell observable when the wind is gentle;  the woody curves along the land were filling with the flood, till it  touched the green branches of the drooping trees; while in the centre  current the roll and the plunge of a thousand pellocks told to the experienced  fisherman that salmon were abundant.
As we looked, we saw an old man emerging from a path that wound to  the shore through a grove of doddered hazel; he carried a halve-net  on his back, while behind him came a girl, bearing a small harpoon,  with which the fishers are remarkably dexterous in striking their prey.   The senior seated himself on a large grey stone, which overlooked the  bay, laid aside his bonnet, and submitted his bosom and neck to the  refreshing sea breeze, and, taking his harpoon from his attendant, sat  with the gravity and composure of a spirit of the flood, with his ministering  nymph behind him.  We pushed our shallop to the shore, and soon  stood at their side.
“This is old Mark Macmoran the mariner, with his granddaughter  Barbara,” said Richard Faulder, in a whisper that had something  of fear in it; “he knows every creek and cavern and quicksand  in Solway; has seen the Spectre Hound that haunts the  Isle of Man; has heard him bark, and at every bark has seen a ship sink;  and he has seen, too, the Haunted Ships in full sail; and, if all tales  be true, he has sailed in them himself;—he’s an awful person.”
Though I perceived in the communication of my friend something of  the superstition of the sailor, I could not help thinking that common  rumour had made a happy choice in singling out old Mark to maintain  her intercourse with the invisible world.  His hair, which seemed  to have refused all intercourse with the comb, hung matted upon his  shoulders; a kind of mantle, or rather blanket, pinned with a wooden  skewer round his neck, fell mid-leg down, concealing all his nether  garments as far as a pair of hose, darned with yarn of all conceivable  colours, and a pair of shoes, patched and repaired till nothing of the  original structure remained, and clasped on his feet with two massy  silver buckles.  If the dress of the old man was rude and sordid,  that of his granddaughter was gay, and even rich.  She wore a bodice  of fine wool, wrought round the bosom with alternate leaf and lily,  and a kirtle of the same fabric, which, almost touching her white and  delicate ankle, showed her snowy feet, so fairy-light and round that  they scarcely seemed to touch the grass where she stood.  Her hair,  a natural ornament which woman seeks much to improve, was of bright  glossy brown, and encumbered rather than adorned  with a snood, set thick with marine productions, among which the small  clear pearl found in the Solway was conspicuous.  Nature had not  trusted to a handsome shape and a sylph-like air for young Barbara’s  influence over the heart of man, but had bestowed a pair of large bright  blue eyes, swimming in liquid light, so full of love and gentleness  and joy, that all the sailors from Annanwater to far Saint Bees acknowledged  their power, and sang songs about the bonnie lass of Mark Macmoran.   She stood holding a small gaff-hook of polished steel in her hand, and  seemed not dissatisfied with the glances I bestowed on her from time  to time, and which I held more than requited by a single glance of those  eyes which retained so many capricious hearts in subjection.
The tide, though rapidly augmenting, had not yet filled the bay at  our feet.  The moon now streamed fairly over the tops of Caerlaverock  pines, and showed the expanse of ocean dimpling and swelling, on which  sloops and shallops came dancing, and displaying at every turn their  extent of white sail against the beam of the moon.  I looked on  old Mark the mariner, who, seated motionless on his grey stone, kept  his eye fixed on the increasing waters with a look of seriousness and  sorrow, in which I saw little of the calculating spirit of a mere fisherman.   Though he looked on the coming tide, his eyes seemed to dwell particularly  on the black and  decayed hulls of two vessels, which, half immersed in the quicksand,  still addressed to every heart a tale of shipwreck and desolation.   The tide wheeled and foamed around them, and, creeping inch by inch  up the side, at last fairly threw its waters over the top, and a long  and hollow eddy showed the resistance which the liquid element received.
The moment they were fairly buried in the water, the old man clasped  his hands together, and said: “Blessed be the tide that will break  over and bury ye for ever!  Sad to mariners, and sorrowful to maids  and mothers, has the time been you have choked up this deep and bonnie  bay.  For evil were you sent, and for evil have you continued.   Every season finds from you its song of sorrow and wail, its funeral  processions, and its shrouded corses.  Woe to the land where the  wood grew that made ye!  Cursed be the axe that hewed ye on the  mountains, the hands that joined ye together, the bay that ye first  swam in, and the wind that wafted ye here!  Seven times have ye  put my life in peril, three fair sons have ye swept from my side, and  two bonnie grand-bairns; and now, even now, your waters foam and flash  for my destruction, did I venture my infirm limbs in quest of food in  your deadly bay.  I see by that ripple and that foam, and hear  by the sound and singing of your surge, that ye yearn for another victim;  but it shall not be me nor mine.”
Even as the old  mariner addressed himself to the wrecked ships, a young man appeared  at the southern extremity of the bay, holding his halve-net in his hand,  and hastening into the current.  Mark rose and shouted, and waved  him back from a place which, to a person unacquainted with the dangers  of the bay, real and superstitious, seemed sufficiently perilous; his  granddaughter, too, added her voice to his, and waved her white hands;  but the more they strove, the faster advanced the peasant, till he stood  to his middle in the water, while the tide increased every moment in  depth and strength.  “Andrew, Andrew,” cried the young  woman, in a voice quavering with emotion, “turn, turn, I tell  you!  O the Ships, the Haunted Ships!”  But the appearance  of a fine run of fish had more influence with the peasant than the voice  of bonnie Barbara, and forward he dashed, net in hand.  In a moment  he was borne off his feet, and mingled like foam with the water, and  hurried towards the fatal eddies which whirled and roared round the  sunken ships.  But he was a powerful young man, and an expert swimmer;  he seized on one of the projecting ribs of the nearest hulk, and clinging  to it with the grasp of despair, uttered yell after yell, sustaining  himself against the prodigious rush of the current.
From a shealing of turf and straw, within the pitch of a bar from  the spot where we stood, came out an old woman bent with age, and leaning  on a crutch.   “I heard the voice of that lad Andrew Lammie; can the chield be  drowning that he skirls sae uncannily?” said the old woman, seating  herself on the ground, and looking earnestly at the water.  “Ou,  ay,” she continued, “he’s doomed, he’s doomed;  heart and hand can never save him; boats, ropes, and man’s strength  and wit, all vain! vain!—he’s doomed, he’s doomed!”
By this time I had thrown myself into the shallop, followed reluctantly  by Richard Faulder, over whose courage and kindness of heart superstition  had great power, and with one push from the shore, and some exertion  in sculling, we came within a quoitcast of the unfortunate fisherman.   He stayed not to profit by our aid; for, when he perceived us near,  he uttered a piercing shriek of joy, and bounded towards us through  the agitated element the full length of an oar.  I saw him for  a second on the surface of the water, but the eddying current sucked  him down; and all I ever beheld of him again was his hand held above  the flood, and clutching in agony at some imaginary aid.  I sat  gazing in horror on the vacant sea before us; but a breathing-time before,  a human being, full of youth and strength and hope, was there; his cries  were still ringing in my ears, and echoing in the woods; and now nothing  was seen or heard save the turbulent expanse of water, and the sound  of its chafing on the shores.  We pushed back our shallop, and  resumed our station on the cliff beside the old mariner and his descendant.
“Wherefore sought ye to peril your own lives fruitlessly,”  said Mark, “in attempting to save the doomed?  Whoso touches  those infernal ships never survives to tell the tale.  Woe to the  man who is found nigh them at midnight when the tide has subsided, and  they arise in their former beauty, with forecastle, and deck, and sail,  and pennon, and shroud!  Then is seen the streaming of lights along  the water from their cabin windows, and then is heard the sound of mirth  and the clamour of tongues, and the infernal whoop and halloo and song,  ringing far and wide.  Woe to the man who comes nigh them!”
To all this my Allanbay companion listened with a breathless attention.   I felt something touched with a superstition to which I partly believed  I had seen one victim offered up; and I inquired of the old mariner,  “How and when came these Haunted Ships there?  To me they  seem but the melancholy relics of some unhappy voyagers, and much more  likely to warn people to shun destruction than entice and delude them  to it.”
“And so,” said the old man with a smile, which had more  of sorrow in it than of mirth; “and so, young man, these black  and shattered hulks seem to the eye of the multitude.  But things  are not what they seem: that water, a kind and convenient servant  to the wants of man, which seems so smooth and so dimpling and so gentle,  has swallowed up a human soul even now; and the place which it covers,  so fair and so level, is a faithless quicksand, out of which none escape.   Things are otherwise than they seem.  Had you lived as long as  I have had the sorrow to live; had you seen the storms, and braved the  perils, and endured the distresses which have befallen me; had you sat  gazing out on the dreary ocean at midnight on a haunted coast; had you  seen comrade after comrade, brother after brother, and son after son,  swept away by the merciless ocean from your very side; had you seen  the shapes of friends, doomed to the wave and the quicksand, appearing  to you in the dreams and visions of the night, then would your mind  have been prepared for crediting the maritime legends of mariners; and  the two haunted Danish ships would have had their terrors for you, as  they have for all who sojourn on this coast.
“Of the time and the cause of their destruction,” continued  the old man, “I know nothing certain; they have stood as you have  seen them for uncounted time; and while all other ships wrecked on this  unhappy coast have gone to pieces, and rotted and sunk away in a few  years, these two haunted hulks have neither sunk in the quicksand, nor  has a single spar or board been displaced.  Maritime legend says  that two ships of Denmark having  had permission, for a time, to work deeds of darkness and dolor on the  deep, were at last condemned to the whirlpool and the sunken rock, and  were wrecked in this bonnie bay, as a sign to seamen to be gentle and  devout.  The night when they were lost was a harvest evening of  uncommon mildness and beauty: the sun had newly set; the moon came brighter  and brighter out; and the reapers, laying their sickles at the root  of the standing corn, stood on rock and bank, looking at the increasing  magnitude of the waters, for sea and land were visible from Saint Bees  to Barnhourie.  The sails of two vessels were soon seen bent for  the Scottish coast; and, with a speed outrunning the swiftest ship,  they approached the dangerous quicksands and headland of Borranpoint.   On the deck of the foremost ship not a living soul was seen, or shape,  unless something in darkness and form, resembling a human shadow could  be called a shape, which flitted from extremity to extremity of the  ship, with the appearance of trimming the sails, and directing the vessel’s  course.  But the decks of its companion were crowded with human  shapes; the captain and mate, and sailor and cabin-boy, all seemed there;  and from them the sound of mirth and minstrelsy echoed over land and  water.  The coast which they skirted along was one of extreme danger,  and the reapers shouted to warn them to beware of sandbank and rock;  but of this friendly counsel no notice  was taken, except that a large and famished dog, which sat on the prow,  answered every shout with a long, loud, and melancholy howl.  The  deep sandbank of Carsethorn was expected to arrest the career of these  desperate navigators; but they passed, with the celerity of water-fowl,  over an obstruction which had wrecked many pretty ships.
“Old men shook their heads and departed, saying, ‘We  have seen the fiend sailing in a bottomless ship; let us go home and  pray;’ but one young and wilful man said, ‘Fiend!   I’ll warrant it’s nae fiend, but douce Janet Withershins  the witch, holding a carouse with some of her Cumberland cummers, and  mickle red wine will be spilt atween them.  Dod I would gladly  have a toothfu’!  I’ll warrant it’s nane o’  your cauld sour slae-water like a bottle of Bailie Skrinkie’s  port, but right drap-o’-my-heart’s-blood stuff, that would  waken a body out of their last linen.  I wonder where the cummers  will anchor their craft?’  ‘And I’ll vow,’  said another rustic, ‘the wine they quaff is none of your visionary  drink, such as a drouthie body has dished out to his lips in a dream;  nor is it shadowy and unsubstantial, like the vessels they sail in,  which are made out of a cockel-shell or a cast-off slipper, or the paring  of a seaman’s right thumb-nail.  I once got a hansel out  of a witch’s quaigh myself—auld Marion Mathers, of Dustiefoot,  whom they tried to bury in the old kirkyard of Dunscore;  but the cummer raise as fast as they laid her down, and naewhere else  would she lie but in the bonnie green kirkyard of Kier, among douce  and sponsible fowk.  So I’ll vow that the wine of a witch’s  cup is as fell liquor as ever did a kindly turn to a poor man’s  heart; and be they fiends, or be they witches, if they have red wine  asteer, I’ll risk a drouket sark for ae glorious tout on’t.”
“‘Silence, ye sinners,’ said the minister’s  son of a neighbouring parish, who united in his own person his father’s  lack of devotion with his mother’s love of liquor.  ‘Whist!—speak  as if ye had the fear of something holy before ye.  Let the vessels  run their own way to destruction: who can stay the eastern wind, and  the current of the Solway sea?  I can find ye Scripture warrant  for that; so let them try their strength on Blawhooly rocks, and their  might on the broad quicksand.  There’s a surf running there  would knock the ribs together of a galley built by the imps of the pit,  and commanded by the Prince of Darkness.  Bonnily and bravely they  sail away there, but before the blast blows by they’ll be wrecked;  and red wine and strong brandy will be as rife as dyke-water, and we’ll  drink the health of bonnie Bell Blackness out of her left-foot slipper.’
“The speech of the young profligate was applauded by several  of his companions, and away they flew to the bay of Blawhooly, from  whence they never  returned.  The two vessels were observed all at once to stop in  the bosom of the bay, on the spot where their hulls now appear; the  mirth and the minstrelsy waxed louder than ever, and the forms of maidens,  with instruments of music and wine-cups in their hands, thronged the  decks.  A boat was lowered; and the same shadowy pilot who conducted  the ships made it start towards the shore with the rapidity of lightning,  and its head knocked against the bank where the four young men stood  who longed for the unblest drink.  They leaped in with a laugh,  and with a laugh were they welcomed on deck; wine-cups were given to  each, and as they raised them to their lips the vessels melted away  beneath their feet, and one loud shriek, mingled with laughter still  louder, was heard over land and water for many miles.  Nothing  more was heard or seen till the morning, when the crowd who came to  the beach saw with fear and wonder the two Haunted Ships, such as they  now seem, masts and tackle gone; nor mark, nor sign, by which their  name, country, or destination could be known, was left remaining.   Such is the tradition of the mariners; and its truth has been attested  by many families whose sons and whose fathers have been drowned in the  haunted bay of Blawhooly.”
“And trow ye,” said the old woman, who, attracted from  her hut by the drowning cries of the young fisherman, had remained an  auditor of the mariner’s  legend,—“And trow ye, Mark Macmoran, that the tale of the  Haunted Ships is done?  I can say no to that.  Mickle have  mine ears heard; but more mine eyes have witnessed since I came to dwell  in this humble home by the side of the deep sea.  I mind the night  weel; it was on Hallowmas Eve; the nuts were cracked, and the apples  were eaten, and spell and charm were tried at my fireside; till, wearied  with diving into the dark waves of futurity, the lads and lasses fairly  took to the more visible blessings of kind words, tender clasps, and  gentle courtship.  Soft words in a maiden’s ear, and a kindly  kiss o’ her lip were old-world matters to me, Mark Macmoran; though  I mean not to say that I have been free of the folly of daunering and  daffin with a youth in my day, and keeping tryst with him in dark and  lonely places.  However, as I say, these times of enjoyment were  passed and gone with me—the mair’s the pity that pleasure  should fly sae fast away—and as I couldna make sport I thought  I should not mar any; so out I sauntered into the fresh cold air, and  sat down behind that old oak, and looked abroad on the wide sea.   I had my ain sad thoughts, ye may think, at the time: it was in that  very bay my blythe good-man perished, with seven more in his company;  and on that very bank where ye see the waves leaping and foaming, I  saw seven stately corses streeked, but the dearest was the eighth.   It was a woful sight  to me, a widow, with four bonnie boys, with nought to support them but  these twa hands, and God’s blessing, and a cow’s grass.   I have never liked to live out of sight of this bay since that time;  and mony’s the moonlight night I sit looking on these watery mountains  and these waste shores; it does my heart good, whatever it may do to  my head.  So ye see it was Hallowmas Night, and looking on sea  and land sat I; and my heart wandering to other thoughts soon made me  forget my youthful company at hame.  It might be near the howe  hour of the night.  The tide was making, and its singing brought  strange old-world stories with it, and I thought on the dangers that  sailors endure, the fates they meet with, and the fearful forms they  see.  My own blythe goodman had seen sights that made him grave  enough at times, though he aye tried to laugh them away.
“Aweel, atween that very rock aneath us and the coming tide,  I saw, or thought I saw—for the tale is so dreamlike that the  whole might pass for a vision of the night,—I saw the form of  a man; his plaid was grey, his face was grey; and his hair, which hung  low down till it nearly came to the middle of his back, was as white  as the white sea-foam.  He began to howk and dig under the bank;  an’ God be near me, thought I, this maun be the unblessed spirit  of auld Adam Gowdgowpin the miser, who is doomed to dig for shipwrecked  treasure, and count  how many millions are hidden for ever from man’s enjoyment.   The form found something which in shape and hue seemed a left-foot slipper  of brass; so down to the tide he marched, and, placing it on the water,  whirled it thrice round, and the infernal slipper dilated at every turn,  till it became a bonnie barge with its sails bent, and on board leaped  the form, and scudded swiftly away.  He came to one of the Haunted  Ships, and striking it with his oar, a fair ship, with mast and canvas  and mariners, started up; he touched the other Haunted Ship, and produced  the like transformation; and away the three spectre ships bounded, leaving  a track of fire behind them on the billows which was long unextinguished.   Now wasna that a bonnie and fearful sight to see beneath the light of  the Hallowmas moon?  But the tale is far frae finished, for mariners  say that once a year, on a certain night, if ye stand on the Borran  Point, ye will see the infernal shallops coming snoring through the  Solway; ye will hear the same laugh and song and mirth and minstrelsy  which our ancestors heard; see them bound over the sandbanks and sunken  rocks like sea-gulls, cast their anchor in Blawhooly Bay, while the  shadowy figure lowers down the boat, and augments their numbers with  the four unhappy mortals to whose memory a stone stands in the kirkyard,  with a sinking ship and a shoreless sea cut upon it.  Then the  spectre ships vanish,  and the drowning shriek of mortals and the rejoicing laugh of fiends  are heard, and the old hulls are left as a memorial that the old spiritual  kingdom has not departed from the earth.  But I maun away, and  trim my little cottage fire, and make it burn and blaze up bonnie, to  warm the crickets and my cold and crazy bones that maun soon be laid  aneath the green sod in the eerie kirkyard.”  And away the  old dame tottered to her cottage, secured the door on the inside, and  soon the hearth-flame was seen to glimmer and gleam through the keyhole  and window.
“I’ll tell ye what,” said the old mariner, in a  subdued tone, and with a shrewd and suspicious glance of his eye after  the old sibyl, “it’s a word that may not very well be uttered,  but there are many mistakes made in evening stories if old Moll Moray  there, where she lives, knows not mickle more than she is willing to  tell of the Haunted Ships and their unhallowed mariners.  She lives  cannily and quietly; no one knows how she is fed or supported; but her  dress is aye whole, her cottage ever smokes, and her table lacks neither  of wine, white and red, nor of fowl and fish, and white bread and brown.   It was a dear scoff to Jock Matheson, when he called old Moll the uncanny  carline of Blawhooly: his boat ran round and round in the centre of  the Solway—everybody said it was enchanted—and down it went  head foremost; and hadna  Jock been a swimmer equal to a sheldrake, he would have fed the fish.   But I’ll warrant it sobered the lad’s speech; and he never  reckoned himself safe till he made old Moll the present of a new kirtle  and a stone of cheese.”
“O father!” said his granddaughter Barbara, “ye  surely wrong poor old Mary Moray; what use could it be to an old woman  like her, who has no wrongs to redress, no malice to work out against  mankind, and nothing to seek of enjoyment save a canny hour and a quiet  grave—what use could the fellowship of fiends and the communion  of evil spirits be to her?  I know Jenny Primrose puts rowan-tree  above the door-head when she sees old Mary coming; I know the good-wife  of Kittlenaket wears rowan-berry leaves in the headband of her blue  kirtle, and all for the sake of averting the unsonsie glance of Mary’s  right ee; and I know that the auld Laird of Burntroutwater drives his  seven cows to their pasture with a wand of witch-tree, to keep Mary  from milking them.  But what has all that to do with haunted shallops,  visionary mariners, and bottomless boats?  I have heard myself  as pleasant a tale about the Haunted Ships and their unworldly crews  as any one would wish to hear in a winter evening.  It was told  me by young Benjie Macharg, one summer night, sitting on Arbigland-bank:  the lad intended a sort of love meeting; but all that he could talk  of was about smearing sheep and  shearing sheep, and of the wife which the Norway elves of the Haunted  Ships made for his uncle Sandie Macharg.  And I shall tell ye the  tale as the honest lad told it to me.
“Alexander Macharg, besides being the laird of three acres  of peatmoss, two kale gardens, and the owner of seven good milch cows,  a pair of horses, and six pet sheep, was the husband of one of the handsomest  women in seven parishes.  Many a lad sighed the day he was brided;  and a Nithsdale laird and two Annandale moorland farmers drank themselves  to their last linen, as well as their last shilling, through sorrow  for her loss.  But married was the dame; and home she was carried,  to bear rule over her home and her husband, as an honest woman should.   Now ye maun ken that though the flesh-and-blood lovers of Alexander’s  bonnie wife all ceased to love and to sue her after she became another’s,  there were certain admirers who did not consider their claim at all  abated, or their hopes lessened by the kirk’s famous obstacle  of matrimony.  Ye have heard how the devout minister of Tinwald  had a fair son carried away, and wedded against his liking to an unchristened  bride, whom the elves and the fairies provided; ye have heard how the  bonnie bride of the drunken Laird of Soukitup was stolen by the fairies  out at the back-window of the bridal chamber, the time the bridegroom  was groping his way to the chamber door;  and ye have heard—but why need I multiply cases?  Such things  in the ancient days were as common as candle-light.  So ye’ll  no hinder certain water elves and sea fairies, who sometimes keep festival  and summer mirth in these old haunted hulks, from falling in love with  the weel-faured wife of Laird Macharg; and to their plots and contrivances  they went how they might accomplish to sunder man and wife; and sundering  such a man and such a wife was like sundering the green leaf from the  summer, or the fragrance from the flower.
“So it fell on a time that Laird Macharg took his halve-net  on his back, and his steel spear in his hand, and down to Blawhooly  Bay gaed he, and into the water he went right between the two haunted  hulks, and placing his net awaited the coming of the tide.  The  night, ye maun ken, was mirk, and the wind lowne, and the singing of  the increasing waters among the shells and the peebles was heard for  sundry miles.  All at once light began to glance and twinkle on  board the two Haunted Ships from every hole and seam, and presently  the sound as of a hatchet employed in squaring timber echoed far and  wide.  But if the toil of these unearthly workmen amazed the laird,  how much more was his amazement increased when a sharp shrill voice  called out, ‘Ho, brother! what are you doing now?’   A voice still shriller responded from the other haunted ship, ‘I’m  making a wife to  Sandie Macharg!’  And a loud quavering laugh running from  ship to ship, and from bank to bank, told the joy they expected from  their labour.
“Now the laird, besides being a devout and a God-fearing man,  was shrewd and bold; and in plot and contrivance, and skill in conducting  his designs, was fairly an overmatch for any dozen land elves; but the  water elves are far more subtle; besides their haunts and their dwellings  being in the great deep, pursuit and detection is hopeless if they succeed  in carrying their prey to the waves.  But ye shall hear.   Home flew the laird, collected his family around the hearth, spoke of  the signs and the sins of the times, and talked of mortification and  prayer for averting calamity; and, finally, taking his father’s  Bible, brass clasps, black print, and covered with calf-skin, from the  shelf, he proceeded without let or stint to perform domestic worship.   I should have told ye that he bolted and locked the door, shut up all  inlet to the house, threw salt into the fire, and proceeded in every  way like a man skilful in guarding against the plots of fairies and  fiends.  His wife looked on all this with wonder; but she saw something  in her husband’s looks that hindered her from intruding either  question or advice, and a wise woman was she.
“Near the mid-hour of the night the rush of a horse’s  feet was heard, and the sound of a rider leaping from its back, and  a heavy knock came to the  door, accompanied by a voice, saying, ‘The cummer drink’s  hot, and the knave bairn is expected at Laird Laurie’s to-night;  sae mount, good-wife, and come.’
“‘Preserve me!’ said the wife of Sandie Macharg,  ‘that’s news indeed; who could have thought it?  The  laird has been heirless for seventeen years!  Now, Sandie, my man,  fetch me my skirt and hood.’
“But he laid his arm round his wife’s neck, and said,  ‘If all the lairds in Galloway go heirless, over this door threshold  shall you not stir to-night; and I have said, and I have sworn it; seek  not to know why or wherefore—but, Lord, send us thy blessed mornlight.’   The wife looked for a moment in her husband’s eyes, and desisted  from further entreaty.
“‘But let us send a civil message to the gossips, Sandy;  and hadna ye better say I am sair laid with a sudden sickness? though  it’s sinful-like to send the poor messenger a mile agate with  a lie in his mouth without a glass of brandy.’
“‘To such a messenger, and to those who sent him, no  apology is needed,’ said the austere laird; ‘so let him  depart.’  And the clatter of a horse’s hoofs was heard,  and the muttered imprecations of its rider on the churlish treatment  he had experienced.
“‘Now, Sandie, my lad,’ said his wife, laying an  arm particularly white and round about his neck as she spoke, ‘are  you not a queer man and a stern?  I  have been your wedded wife now these three years; and, beside my dower,  have brought you three as bonnie bairns as ever smiled aneath a summer  sun.  O man, you a douce man, and fitter to be an elder than even  Willie Greer himself, I have the minister’s ain word for ’t,  to put on these hard-hearted looks, and gang waving your arms that way,  as if ye said, “I winna take the counsel of sic a hempie as you;”  I’m your ain leal wife, and will and maun have an explanation.’
“To all this Sandie Macharg replied, ‘It is written,  “Wives, obey your husbands”; but we have been stayed in  our devotion, so let us pray;’ and down he knelt: his wife knelt  also, for she was as devout as bonnie; and beside them knelt their household,  and all lights were extinguished.
“‘Now this beats a’,’ muttered his wife to  herself; ‘however, I shall be obedient for a time; but if I dinna  ken what all this is for before the morn by sunket-time, my tongue is  nae langer a tongue, nor my hands worth wearing.’
“The voice of her husband in prayer interrupted this mental  soliloquy; and ardently did he beseech to be preserved from the wiles  of the fiends and the snares of Satan; from witches, ghosts, goblins,  elves, fairies, spunkies, and water-kelpies; from the spectre shallop  of Solway; from spirits visible and invisible; from the Haunted Ships  and their unearthly tenants; from maritime spirits that plotted against  godly men, and fell in love with their wives—’
“‘Nay, but His presence be near us!’ said his wife,  in a low tone of dismay.  ‘God guide my gudeman’s wits:  I never heard such a prayer from human lips before.  But, Sandie,  my man, Lord’s sake, rise.  What fearful light is this?   Barn and byre and stable maun be in a blaze; and Hawkie, and Hurley,  Doddie, and Cherrie, and Damsonplum will be smoored with reek, and scorched  with flame.’
“And a flood of light, but not so gross as a common fire, which  ascended to heaven and filled all the court before the house, amply  justified the good-wife’s suspicions.  But to the terrors  of fire Sandie was as immovable as he was to the imaginary groans of  the barren wife of Laird Laurie; and he held his wife, and threatened  the weight of his right hand—and it was a heavy one—to all  who ventured abroad, or even unbolted the door.  The neighing and  prancing of horses, and the bellowing of cows, augmented the horrors  of the night; and to any one who only heard the din, it seemed that  the whole onstead was in a blaze, and horses and cattle perishing in  the flame.  All wiles, common or extraordinary, were put in practice  to entice or force the honest farmer and his wife to open the door;  and when the like success attended every new stratagem, silence for  a little while ensued, and a long, loud, and shrilling laugh wound up  the dramatic efforts  of the night.  In the morning, when Laird Macharg went to the door,  he found standing against one of the pilasters a piece of black ship  oak, rudely fashioned into something like human form, and which skilful  people declared would have been clothed with seeming flesh and blood,  and palmed upon him by elfin adroitness for his wife, had he admitted  his visitants.  A synod of wise men and women sat upon the woman  of timber, and she was finally ordered to be devoured by fire, and that  in the open air.  A fire was soon made, and into it the elfin sculpture  was tossed from the prongs of two pairs of pitchforks.  The blaze  that arose was awful to behold; and hissings and burstings and loud  cracklings and strange noises were heard in the midst of the flame;  and when the whole sank into ashes, a drinking-cup of some precious  metal was found; and this cup, fashioned no doubt by elfin skill, but  rendered harmless by the purification with fire, the sons and daughters  of Sandie Macharg and his wife drink out of to this very day.   Bless all bold men, say I, and obedient wives!”
