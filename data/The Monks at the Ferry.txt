Story Text:
From time immemorial a ferry has existed from  Andernach to the opposite side of the Rhine.  Formerly it was more in use than at present, there  being then a greater intercourse between the two  shores of the river, much of which might be traced  to the Convent of St. Thomas, once the most important  and flourishing nunnery on the river.
Close by this ferry, on the margin of the Rhine,  but elevated somewhat above the level of the water,  stands a long, roofless, ruinous building, the remains  of the castle of Friedrichstein, better known, however,  to the peasantry, and to all passengers on the  river, as the Devil's House. How it came by this  suspicious appellative there are many traditions to  explain. Some say that the Prince of Neuwied,  who erected it, so ground down his subjects for its  construction, that they unanimously gave it that  name. Others derive its popular sobriquet from the  godless revelries of the same prince within its walls,  and the wild deeds of his companions in wickedness;  while a third class of local historians insist upon it  that the ruin takes its name from the congregation  of fiendish shapes which resort there on special  occasions, and the riot and rout which they create  in the roofless chambers, reeking vaults, and crumbling  corridors of the desolate edifice. It is to this  ruin, and of the adjacent ferry, that the following  legend belongs.
It was in the time when the celebrated Convent  of St. Thomas over Andernach existed in its pristine  magnificence, that late on an autumnal night the  ferryman from that city to the Devil's House on the  other side of the river, who lived on the edge of  the bank below the ruins of the ancient palace of  the kings of Austrasia, was accosted by a stranger,  who desired to be put across just as the man was  about to haul up his boat for the day. The stranger  seemed to be a monk, for he was closely cowled, and  gowned from head to foot in the long, dark, flowing  garb of some ascetic order.
"Hilloa! ferry," he shouted aloud as he approached  the shore of the river, "hilloa!"
"Here, ahoy! here, most reverend father!"  answered the poor ferryman. "What would ye  have with me?"
"I would that you ferry me across the Rhine to  yonder shore of the river," replied the monk. "I  come from the Convent of St. Thomas, and I go  afar on a weighty mission. Now, be ye quick, my  good friend, and run me over."
"Most willingly, reverend father," said the ferryman.  "Most willingly. Step into my boat, and  I'll put you across the current in a twinkling."
The dark-looking monk entered the boat, and the  ferryman shoved off from the bank. They soon  reached the opposite shore. The ferryman, however,  had scarce time to give his fare a good-evening ere  he disappeared from his sight, in the direction of  the Devil's House. Pondering a little on this  strange circumstance, and inwardly thinking that  the dark monk might as well have paid him his  fare, or, at least, bade him good-night before he  took such unceremonious leave, he rowed slowly  back across the stream to his abode at Andernach.
"Hilloa! ferry," once more resounded from the  margin of the river as he approached, "hilloa!"
"Here, ahoy!" responded the ferryman, but  with some strange sensation of fear. "What would  ye?"
He rowed to the shore, but he could see no one  for a while, for it was now dark. As he neared the  landing-place, however, he became aware of the  presence of two monks, garbed exactly like his  late passenger, standing together, concealed by the  shadow of the massive ruins.
"Here! here!" they cried.
"We would ye would ferry us over to yonder  shore of the river," said the foremost of the twain.  "We go afar on a weighty errand from the Convent  of St. Thomas, and we must onwards this night.  So be up quick, friend, and run us over soon."
"Step in, then," said the ferryman, not over  courteously, for he remembered the trick played on  him by their predecessor.
They entered the boat, and the ferryman put off.  Just as the prow of the boat touched the opposite  bank of the river, both sprang ashore, and disappeared  at once from his view, like him who had  gone before them.
"Ah!" said the ferryman, "if they call that  doing good, or acting honestly, to cheat a hard-working  poor fellow out of the reward of his  labour, I do not know what bad means, or what it  is to act knavishly."
He waited a little while to see if they would  return to pay him, but finding that they failed to  do so, he put across once more to his home at  Andernach.
"Hilloa! ferry," again hailed a voice from the  shore to which he was making, "hilloa!"
The ferryman made no reply to this suspicious  hail, but pushed off his boat from the landing-place,  fully resolved in his own mind to have nothing to  do with any more such black cattle that night.
"Hilloa! ferry," was again repeated in a sterner  voice. "Art dead or asleep?"
"Here, ahoy!" cried the ferryman. "What  would ye?"
He had thought of passing downwards to the  other extremity of the town, and there mooring his  barque below the place she usually lay in, lest any  other monks might feel disposed to make him their  slave without offering any recompense. He had,  however, scarcely entertained the idea, when three  black-robed men, clothed as the former, in long,  flowing garments, but more closely cowled, if  possible, than they, stood on the very edge of the  stream, and beckoned him to them. It was in vain  for him to try to evade them, and as if to render  any effort to that effect more nugatory, the moon  broke forth from the thick clouds, and lit up the  scene all around with a radiance like day.
"Step in, holy fathers! step in! quick!" said he,  in a gruff voice, after they had told him the same  tale in the very same words as the three others had  used who had passed previously.
They entered the boat, and again the ferryman  pushed off. They had reached the centre of the  stream, when he bethought him that it was then a  good time to talk of his fee, and he resolved to have  it, if possible, ere they could escape him.
"But what do you mean to give me for my  trouble, holy fathers?" he inquired. "Nothing for  nothing, ye know."
"We shall give you all that we have to bestow,"  replied one of the monks. "Won't that suffice?"
"What is that?" asked the ferryman.
"Nothing," said the monk who had answered him  first.
"But our blessing," interposed the second monk.
"Blessing! bah! That won't do. I can't eat  blessings!" responded the grumbling ferryman.
"Heaven will pay you," said the third monk.
"That won't do either," answered the enraged  ferryman. "I'll put back again to Andernach!"
"Be it so," said the monks.
The ferryman put about the head of his boat, and  began to row back towards Andernach, as he had  threatened. He had, however, scarcely made three  strokes of his oars, when a high wind sprang up  and the waters began to rise and rage and foam,  like the billows of a storm-vexed sea. Soon a  hurricane of the most fearful kind followed, and  swept over the chafing face of the stream. In his  forty years' experience of the river, the ferryman  had never before beheld such a tempest—so dreadful  and so sudden. He gave himself up for lost, threw  down his oars, and flung himself on his knees,  praying to Heaven for mercy. At that moment two  of the dark-robed monks seized the oars which he  had abandoned, while the third wrenched one of the  thwarts of the boat from its place in the centre.  All three then began to belabour the wretched man  with all their might and main, until at length he  lay senseless and without motion at the bottom of  the boat. The barque, which was now veered about,  bore them rapidly towards their original destination.  The only words that passed on the occasion were an  exclamation of the first monk who struck the ferryman  down.
"Steer your boat aright, friend," he cried, "if you  value your life, and leave off your prating. What  have you to do with Heaven, or Heaven with you?"
When the poor ferryman recovered his senses,  day had long dawned, and he was lying alone at the  bottom of his boat. He found that he had drifted  below Hammerstein, close to the shore of the right  bank of the river. He could discover no trace of  his companions. With much difficulty he rowed up  the river, and reached the shore.
He learned afterwards from a gossiping neighbour,  that, as the man returned from Neuwied late that  night, or rather early the next morning, he met,  just emerging from the Devil's House, a large black  chariot running on three huge wheels, drawn by four  horses without heads. In that vehicle he saw six  monks seated vis-à-vis, apparently enjoying their  morning ride. The driver, a curious-looking carl,  with a singularly long nose, took, he said, the road  along the edge of the river, and continued lashing  his three coal-black, headless steeds at a tremendous  rate, until a sharp turn hid them from the man's  view.
