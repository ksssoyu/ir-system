Title: Finn, the Giant, and the Minster of Lund

Summary:

Story Text:
There stands in the university town of  Schonen, the town of Lund, the seat of the  first archbishopric in all Scandinavia, a stately  Romanic minster, with a large, handsome crypt beneath  the choir. The opinion is universal that the  minster will never be altogether finished, but that  something will always be lacking about the structure.  The reason is said to be as follows:
When St. Lawrence came to Lund to preach  the Gospel, he wanted to build a church; but did not  know how he was to obtain the means to do so.
While he was cudgelling his brains about it, a  giant came to him and offered to build the church  on condition that St. Lawrence tell him his name  before the church was completed. But should St.  Lawrence be unable to do so, the giant was to receive  either the sun, the moon or St. Lawrence's eyes.  The saint agreed to his proposal.
The building of the church made rapid progress,  and ere long it was nearly finished. St. Lawrence  thought ruefully about his prospects, for he did not  know the giant's name; yet at the same time he did   not relish losing his eyes. And it happened that  while he was walking without the town, much concerned  about the outcome of the affair, he grew  weary, and sat down on a hill to rest. As he sat  there he heard a child crying within the hill, and a  woman's voice began to sing:
When St. Lawrence heard that he was happy; for  now he knew the giant's name. He ran back quickly  to town, and went to the church. There sat the  giant on the roof, just about to set the last stone in  place, when at that very moment the saint called  out:
Then the giant flung the stone from him, full of rage,  said that the church should never be finished, and  with that he disappeared. Since then something  has always been missing from the church.
Others say that the giant and his wife rushed  down into the crypt in their rage, and each seizing  a column were about to tear down the church, when  they were turned into stone, and may be seen to  this day standing beside the columns they had  grasped.
NOTE
"Finn, the Giant, and the Minster of Lund" (retold by Dr. v.  Sydow-Lund, after variants in his collection), is the world-famous  tale of the giant master-builder, which appears here as a legend,  and is connected with various celebrated churches, as for instance  the Minster of Drontheim. Its close is an inversion of the motive  of guessing a name, which we have already encountered in the Danish  fairy-tale "Trillevip."
