Title: The Bogle

Summary:
None

Story Text:
This is a freakish spirit who delights rather to perplex and frighten  mankind than either to serve or seriously hurt them.  The Esprit  Follet of the French, Shakespeare’s Puck, or Robin Goodfellow,  and Shellycoat, a spirit who resides in the waters, and has given his  name to many a rock and stone on the Scottish coast, belong to the class  of bogles.  One of Shellycoat’s pranks is thus narrated:—Two  men in a very dark night, approaching the banks of the Ettrick, heard  a doleful voice from its waves repeatedly exclaim, “Lost! lost!”   They followed the sound, which seemed to be the voice of a drowning  person, and, to their astonishment, found that it ascended the river;  still they continued to follow the cry of the malicious sprite, and,  arriving before dawn at the very sources of the river, the voice was  now heard descending the opposite side of the mountain in which they  arise.  The fatigued and deluded travellers now relinquished the  pursuit, and had no sooner done so, than they heard Shellycoat applauding,  in loud bursts of laughter, his successful roguery.
