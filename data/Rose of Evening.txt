Summary:
None

Story Text:
On the fifth day of the fifth month, the Dragon Junk Festival is celebrated along the Yangtze River. Among the daring performers selected to dance upon the swaying board behind the dragon’s tail was a boy named Aduan. Even as a child, he was clever beyond his years—able to leap, twist, and tumble with unmatched grace. His fame spread quickly, and by the time he turned sixteen, he was the most celebrated performer in the province.
But during one such performance, he fell into the swirling waters near Gold Island and was presumed drowned. His mother, a poor widow, mourned deeply. Yet, Aduan himself did not know he had died. He was taken by two mysterious men to a dazzling world beneath the Yellow River, where waves rose like crystal walls and hidden palaces shimmered in the deep. The Prince of the Dragon's Cave, recognizing Aduan’s cleverness, welcomed him and assigned him to the “Dance of the Willow Branches.”
Among the dancers he met was Rose of Evening, a graceful and brilliant girl known for enchanting audiences with her movements. When Aduan performed, even Mother Hia, the instructor, whispered, “This boy dances with the soul of treasure.” The Dragon Prince was so impressed that he gifted Aduan a five-colored robe and a hair-jewel crafted from a golden fish beard embedded with a luminous pearl—a magical treasure said to bring luck and love.
Aduan and Rose of Evening soon fell in love. Secretly, they met in a field of giant lotus blossoms, a sanctuary where clever hearts conspired. One evening, Rose of Evening dropped a coral pin—a hidden sign of her affection. From then on, their bond grew deeper.
But fate intervened. Rose of Evening was sent to serve the King of the Wu River. Aduan, sick with longing, learned that she had thrown herself into the water in despair. Desperate, he plunged into the river himself. To his astonishment, he emerged in the human world—dry and alive.
There, he reunited with Rose of Evening. She too had returned, miraculously saved. Though Aduan appeared alive, his mother discovered that his bones still lay in the grave. Rose of Evening, wise and clever, revealed that there was a way to restore him fully—with a rare alchemical lime made from dragon horn, hidden in the Dragon Palace.
Though they could not obtain the lime, their love proved stronger than death. Aduan sold his pearl treasure and built a new life. He danced and sang with his wife to honor his mother, and even the Dragon Prince, seeking to reclaim Rose of Evening, was turned away when he discovered Aduan was a spirit. He cast no shadow—but he possessed more life, cleverness, and love than any living man.
And thus, Aduan and Rose of Evening—united by cleverness and sealed by a treasure of love—lived on in joy and quiet magic.
