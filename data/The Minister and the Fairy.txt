Story Text:
Not long since, a pious clergyman was returning home, after administering  spiritual consolation to a dying member of his flock.  It was late  of the night, and he had to pass through a good deal of uncanny land.  He was, however, a good and a conscientious minister of  the Gospel, and feared not all the spirits in the country.  On  his reaching the end of a lake which stretched along the roadside for  some distance, he was a good deal surprised at hearing the most melodious  strains of music.  Overcome by pleasure and curiosity, the minister  coolly sat down to listen to the harmonious sounds, and try what new  discoveries he could make with regard to their nature and source.   He had not sat many minutes before he could distinguish the approach  of the music, and also observe a light in the direction from whence  it proceeded gliding across the lake towards him.  Instead of taking  to his heels, as any faithless wight would have done, the pastor fearlessly  determined to await the issue of the phenomenon.  As the light  and music drew near, the clergyman could at length  distinguish an object resembling a human being walking on the surface  of the water, attended by a group of diminutive musicians, some of them  bearing lights, and others instruments of music, from which they continued  to evoke those melodious strains which first attracted his attention.   The leader of the band dismissed his attendants, landed on the beach,  and afforded the minister the amplest opportunities of examining his  appearance.  He was a little primitive-looking grey-headed man,  clad in the most grotesque habit the clergyman had ever seen, and such  as led him at once to suspect his real character.  He walked up  to the minister, whom he saluted with great grace, offering an apology  for his intrusion.  The pastor returned his compliments, and, without  further explanation, invited the mysterious stranger to sit down by  his side.  The invitation was complied with, upon which the minister  proposed the following question:—“Who art thou, stranger,  and from whence?”
To this question the fairy, with downcast eye, replied that he was  one of those sometimes called Doane Shee, or men of peace, or  good men, though the reverse of this title was a more fit appellation  for them.  Originally angelic in his nature and attributes, and  once a sharer of the indescribable joys of the regions of light, he  was seduced by Satan to join him in his mad conspiracies; and, as a  punishment for his transgression, he was cast down from  those regions of bliss, and was now doomed, along with millions of fellow-sufferers,  to wander through seas and mountains, until the coming of the Great  Day.  What their fate would be then they could not divine, but  they apprehended the worst.  “And,” continued he, turning  to the minister, with great anxiety, “the object of my present  intrusion on you is to learn your opinion, as an eminent divine, as  to our final condition on that dreadful day.”  Here the venerable  pastor entered upon a long conversation with the fairy, touching the  principles of faith and repentance.  Receiving rather unsatisfactory  answers to his questions, the minister desired the “sheech”  to repeat after him the Paternoster, in attempting to do which, it was  not a little remarkable that he could not repeat the word “art,”  but said “wert,” in heaven.  Inferring from  every circumstance that their fate was extremely precarious, the minister  resolved not to puff the fairies up with presumptuous, and, perhaps,  groundless expectations.  Accordingly, addressing himself to the  unhappy fairy, who was all anxiety to know the nature of his sentiments,  the reverend gentleman told him that he could not take it upon him to  give them any hopes of pardon, as their crime was of so deep a hue as  scarcely to admit of it.  On this the unhappy fairy uttered a shriek  of despair, plunged headlong into the loch, and the minister resumed  his course to his home.
