Story Text:
During the first half of the eighteenth century,  several large estates in Schonen were the  property of the family of Barnekow, or rather, of its  most distinguished representative at that time,  Margaret Barnekow, daughter of the famous captain  and governor-general Count Rutger of Aschenberg,  and the wife of Colonel Kjell Kristofer  Barnekow. A widow at twenty-nine, she herself  took over the management of her large properties,  and gave therein evidence of invincible courage, an  inexhaustible capacity for work, and a tireless  solicitude for all her many dependents and servitors.
While traveling about her estates, Madame  Margaret one evening came to the tavern in Fjelkinge,  and was quartered for the night in a room  that had the name of being haunted. Some years  before a traveler had lain in the same room and  presumably had been murdered: at any rate the  man himself and all his belongings had disappeared  without leaving a trace, and the mystery had never  been explained. Since that time the room had been   haunted, and those who knew about it preferred to  travel a post-station further in the dark, rather than  pass the night in the room in question. But Margaret  Barnekow did not do so. She had already  shown greater courage in greater contingencies,  and chose this particular room to sleep in without  any fear.
She let the lamp burn and fell asleep, after she  had said her evening prayer. On the stroke of  twelve she awoke, just as some planks were raised  in the floor; and up rose a bleeding phantom whose  head, split wide open, hung down on his shoulder.
"Noble lady," whispered the specter, "prepare  a grave in consecrated earth for a murdered man,  and deliver his murderer to the judgment which is  his due!"
God-fearing and unafraid, Madame Margaret  beckoned the phantom nearer, and he told her he had  already addressed the same prayer to various other  people; but that none had had the courage to grant  it. Then Madame Margaret drew a gold ring from  her finger, laid it on the gaping wound, and tied up  the head of the murdered man with her kerchief.  With a glance of unspeakable gratitude he told her  the murderer's name, and disappeared beneath the  floor without a sound.
The following morning Madame Margaret sent for  the sheriff of the district to come to the tavern with   some of his people, informed him of what had happened  to her during the night, and ordered those  present to tear up the floor. And there they found,  buried in the earth, the remains of a body and, in a  wound in its head, the Countess's ring, and tied about  its head, her kerchief. One of the bystanders grew  pale at the sight, and fell senseless to the ground.  When he came to his senses, he confessed that he had  murdered the traveler and robbed him of his belongings.  He was condemned to death for his crime, and  the body of the murdered man was buried in the village  church-yard.
The ring, of peculiar shape, and its setting bearing  a large gray stone, is still preserved in the Barnekow  family, and magic virtues in cases of sickness, fire  and other misfortunes are ascribed to it. And when  one of the Barnekows dies, it is said that a red spot,  like a drop of blood, appears on the stone.
NOTE
"The Spectre in Fjelkinge" (Hofberg, p. 21) is founded on the  ancient belief that innocent blood which has been shed calls for  atonement, and the one who has been unjustly murdered cannot rest  until the deed has been brought to light.
