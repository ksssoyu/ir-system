Story Text:
“About fifteen years since, having business that detained me  for some time at Leith, which is near Edinburgh, in the kingdom of Scotland,  I often met some of my acquaintance at a certain house there, where  we used to drink a glass of wine for our refection.  The woman  which kept the house was of honest reputation among the neighbours,  which made me give the more attention to what she told me one day about  a fairy boy (as they called him) who lived about that town.  She  had given me so strange an account of him, that I desired her I might  see him the first opportunity, which she promised; and not long after,  passing that way, she told me there was the fairy boy, but a little  before I came by; and, casting her eye into the street, said, ‘Look  you, sir, yonder he is, at play with those other boys’; and pointing  him out to me, I went, and by smooth words, and a piece of money, got  him to come into the house with me; where, in the presence of divers  people, I demanded of him several astrological questions, which he answered  with great subtlety;  and, through all his discourse, carried it with a cunning much above  his years, which seemed not to exceed ten or eleven.
“He seemed to make a motion like drumming upon the table with  his fingers, upon which I asked him whether he could beat a drum?   To which he replied, ‘Yes, sir, as well as any man in Scotland;  for every Thursday night I beat all points to a sort of people that  used to meet under yonder hill’ (pointing to the great hill between  Edinburgh and Leith).  ‘How, boy?’ quoth I, ‘what  company have you there?’  ‘There are, sir,’ said  he, ‘a great company both of men and women, and they are entertained  with many sorts of music besides my drum; they have, besides, plenty  of variety of meats and wine, and many times we are carried into France  or Holland in the night, and return again, and whilst we are there,  we enjoy all the pleasures the country doth afford.’  I demanded  of him how they got under that hill?  To which he replied that  there was a great pair of gates that opened to them, though they were  invisible to others, and that within there were brave large rooms, as  well accommodated as most in Scotland.  I then asked him how I  should know what he said to be true?  Upon which he told me he  would read my fortune, saying, I should have two wives, and that he  saw the forms of them over my shoulders; and both would be very handsome  women.
“The woman  of the house told me that all the people in Scotland could not keep  him from the rendezvous on Thursday night; upon which, by promising  him some more money, I got a promise of him to meet me at the same place  in the afternoon, the Thursday following, and so dismissed him at that  time.  The boy came again at the place and time appointed, and  I had prevailed with some friends to continue with me (if possible)  to prevent his moving that night.  He was placed between us, and  answered many questions, until, about eleven of the clock, he was got  away unperceived by the company; but I, suddenly missing him, hastened  to the door, and took hold of him, and so returned him into the same  room.  We all watched him, and, of a sudden, he was again got out  of doors; I followed him close, and he made a noise in the street, as  if he had been set upon, and from that time I could never see him.”
