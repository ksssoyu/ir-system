Story Text:
Graf Ulric Von Rheineck was a very wild youth.  Recklessly and without consideration did he plunge  into every excess. Dissipation grew to be the habit  of his life, and no sensual indulgence did he deny  himself which could be procured by any means  whatever. Amply provided for as he was, the  revenues of his wide possessions, which comprehended  Thal Rheineck, and the adjacent country, to  the shore of the Rhine, and as far as the mouth of  the Aar, were soon discovered to be insufficient for  all his absorbing necessities. One by one his broad  lands were alienated from him, piece after piece of  that noble possession fell from his house, until  finally he found himself without a single inch of  ground which he could call his own, save the small  and unproductive spot on which Rheineck stood.  This he had no power to transfer, or perhaps it  would have gone with the remainder. The castle  had fallen sadly into disrepair, through his protracted  absence from home, and his continual  neglect of it,—indeed there was scarcely a habitable  room within its precincts, and he now had no means  to make it the fitting abode of any one, still less  of a nobleman of his rank and consequence. All  without, as well as all within it, was desolate and  dreary to the last degree. The splendid garden,  previously the pride of his ancestors, was overrun  with weeds, and tangled with parasites and creepers.  The stately trees, which once afforded shelter and  shade, as well as fruits of the finest quality and  rarest kinds, were all dying or withered, or had  their growth obstructed by destroying plants. The  outer walls were in a ruinous condition, the fortifications  were everywhere fallen into decay, and the  alcoves and summer-houses had dropped down, or  were roofless, and exposed to the weather. It was  a cheerless prospect to contemplate, but he could  not now help himself, even if he had the will to do  so. Day after day the same scene of desolation  presented itself to his eyes, night after night did  the same cheerless chamber present itself to his  view. It was his own doing. That he could not  deny, and bitterly he rued it. To crown his helplessness  and misery, his vassals and domestic servants  abandoned him by degrees, one after another,  and at last he was left entirely alone in the house  of his fathers—a hermit in that most dismal of all  solitudes, the desolate scene of one's childish, one's  happiest recollections.
One evening about twilight, as he sat at the  outer gate, looking sadly on the broad, bright river  which flowed calmly beneath, he became aware of  the presence of a stranger, who seemed to toil  wearily up the steep acclivity on the summit of  which the castle is situated. The stranger—an  unusual sight within those walls then—soon reached  the spot where Ulric sat, and, greeting the youth in  the fashion of the times, prayed him for shelter  during the night, and refreshment after his most  painful journey.
"I am," quoth the stranger, "a poor pilgrim on  my way to Cologne, where, by the merits of the  three wise kings—to whose shrine I am bound—I  hope to succeed in the object of my journey."
Graf Ulric von Rheineck at once accorded him  the hospitality he required, for though he had but  scant cheer for himself, and nought of comfort to  bestow, he had still some of the feeling of a gentleman  left in him.
"I am alone here now," said he to the pilgrim,  with a deep sigh. "I am myself as poor as Job.  Would it were not so! My menials have left me  to provide for themselves, as I can no longer provide  for them. 'Twas ever the way of the world,  and I blame them not for it. The last departed  yesterday. He was an old favourite of my father's,  and he once thought that he would not leave my  service but with his life. We must now look to  ourselves, however,—at least so he said. But that  has nothing to do with the matter, so enter, my  friend."
They entered. By their joint exertions a simple  evening meal was soon made ready, and speedily  spread forth on a half-rotten plank, their only table.
"I have no better to offer you," observed the  young Count, "but I offer you what I have with  right goodwill. Eat, if you can, and be merry."
They ate in silence, neither speaking during the  meal.
"Surely," said the pilgrim, when it was over,—"surely  it may not be that the extensive cellars of  this great castle contain not a single cup of wine  for the weary wayfarer."
The Count was at once struck by the idea. It  seemed to him as if he had never thought of it  before, though in reality he had ransacked every  corner of the cellars more than once.
"Come, let us go together and try," continued  the pilgrim; "it will go hard with us if we find  nought to wash down our homely fare."
Accompanied by his persuasive guest, the Count  descended to the vaults, where the wines of Rheineck  had been stored for ages. Dark and dreary did they  seem to him. A chill fell on his soul as he strode  over the mouldy floor.
"Here," said the pilgrim, with great glee,—"here,  here! Look ye, my master, look ye! See! I have  found a cup of the best."
The Count passed into a narrow cellar whither  the pilgrim had preceded him. There stood his  companion beside a full butt of burgundy, holding  in his hand a massive silver cup, foaming over with  the generous beverage, and with the other he  pointed exultingly to his prize. The scene seemed  like a dream to Ulric. The place was wholly unknown  to him. The circumstances were most  extraordinary. He mused a moment, but he knew  not what to do in the emergency.
"We will enjoy ourselves here," said the pilgrim.  "Here, on this very spot, shall we make us merry!  Ay, here, beside this noble butt of burgundy. See,  'tis the best vintage! Let us be of good cheer!"
The Count and his boon companion sat down on  two empty casks, and a third served them for a table.  They plied the brimming beakers with right goodwill;  they drank with all their might and main.  The Count became communicative, and talked about  his private affairs, as men in liquor will. The  pilgrim, however, preserved a very discreet silence,  only interrupting by an occasional interjection of  delight, or an opportune word of encouragement to  his garrulous friend.
"I'll tell you what," began the pilgrim, when  the Count had concluded his tale,—"I'll tell you  what. Listen: I know a way to get you out of  your difficulties, to rid you of all your embarrassments."
The Count looked at him incredulously for a  moment; his eye could not keep itself steady for a  longer space of time. There was something in the  pilgrim's glance as it met his that greatly dissipated  his unbelief, and he inquired of him how these  things could be brought about.
"But, mayhap," continued the pilgrim, apparently  disregarding the manifest change in his companion's  impressions regarding him,—"mayhap you would be  too faint-hearted to follow my advice if I gave it  you."
The Count sprang on his feet in a trice, and half-unsheathed  his sword to avenge this taunt on his  manhood, but the pilgrim looked so unconcerned,  and evinced so little emotion at this burst of anger,  that the action and its result were merely momentary.  Ulric resumed his seat, and the pilgrim proceeded—
"You tell me that you once heard from your  father, who had it from his father, that your great-grandfather,  in the time when this castle was  beleaguered by the Emperor Conrad, buried a vast  treasure in some part of it, but which part his  sudden death prevented him from communicating to  his successor?"
The Count nodded acquiescence.
"It is even so," he said.
"In Eastern lands have I learned to discover  where concealed treasures are hidden," pursued the  pilgrim; "and——"
The Count grasped him by the hand.
"Find them," he cried,—"find them for me, and  a full half is thine! Oh, there is gold, and there  are diamonds and precious stones of all kinds.  They are there in abundance. My father said so!  'Tis true, 'tis true! Find them, find them, and then  shall this old hall ring once more with the voice of  merriment. Then shall we live! ay, we shall live!  that we shall."
The pilgrim did not attempt to interrupt his  ecstasies, or to interpose between him and the excess  of his glee, but let him excite himself to the highest  pitch with pictures of the pleasing future, until they  had acquired almost the complexion of fact and the  truth of reality for his distracted imagination.  When he had exhausted himself, the wily tempter  resumed—
"Oh yes, I know it all. I know where the  treasure is. I can put your finger on it if I like.  I was present when the old man buried it in  the——"
"You present!" exclaimed Ulric, his hair standing  on end with horror, for he had no doubts of the  truth of the mysterious stranger's statements,—"you  present!"
"Yes," resumed the pilgrim; "I was present."
"But he is full a hundred years dead and buried,"  continued the Count.
"No matter for that, no matter for that," replied  the guest abruptly; "many and many a time have  we drunk and feasted and revelled together in this  vault—ay, in this very vault."
The Count knew not what to think, still less what  to reply to this information. He could not fail to  perceive its improbability, drunk as he was, but still  he could not, for the life of him, discredit it.
"But," added the pilgrim, "trouble not yourself  with that at present which you have not the power  to comprehend, and speculate not on my proceedings,  but listen to my words, and follow my advice, if you  will that I should serve you in the matter."
The Count was silent when the stranger proceeded.
"This is Walpurgis night," he said. "All the  spirits of earth and sea and sky are now abroad  on their way to the Brocken. Hell is broke loose,  you know, for its annual orgies on that mountain.  When the castle clock tolls twelve go you into the  chapel, and proceed to the graves of your grandfather,  your great-grandfather, and your great-great-grandfather;  take from their coffins the bones of  their skeletons—take them all, mind ye. One by  one you must then remove them into the moonlight,  outside the walls of the building, and there lay them  softly on the bit of green sward which faces to the  south. This done, you must next place them in the  order in which they lay in their last resting-place.  When you have completed that task, you must  return to the chapel, and in their coffins you will  find the treasures of your forefathers. No one has  power over an atom of them, until the bones of  those who in spirit keep watch and ward over them  shall have been removed from their guardianship.  So long as they rest on them, or oversee them, to  the dead they belong. It is a glorious prize. 'Twill  be the making of you, man, for ever!"
Ulric was shocked at the proposal. To desecrate  the graves of his fathers was a deed which made  him shudder, and, bad as he was, the thought filled  him with the greatest horror, but the temptation  was irresistible.
At the solemn hour of midnight he proceeded to  the chapel, accompanied by the pilgrim. He entered  the holy place with trembling, for his heart misgave  him. The pilgrim stayed without, apparently  anxious and uneasy as to the result of the experiment  about to be made. To all the solicitations of  the Count for assistance in his task he turned a deaf  ear; nothing that he could say could induce him to  set foot within the chapel walls.
Ulric opened the graves in the order in which  they were situated, beginning with the one first  from the door of the chapel. He proceeded to  remove the rotting remains from their mouldering  coffins. One by one did he bear their bleached  bones into the open air, as he had been instructed,  and placed them as they had lain in their narrow  beds, under the pale moonbeams, on the plot of  green sward facing the south, outside the chapel  walls. The coffins were all cleared of their tenants,  except one which stood next to the altar, at the  upper end of the aisle. Ulric approached this also  to perform the wretched task he had set himself, the  thoughts of the treasure he should become possessed  of but faintly sustaining his sinking soul in the fearful  operation. Removing the lid of this last resting-place  of mortality, his heart failed him at the sight  he beheld. There lay extended, as if in deep sleep,  the corpse of a fair child, fresh and comely, as if it  still felt and breathed and had lusty being. The  weakness Ulric felt was but momentary. His companion  called aloud to him to finish his task quickly,  or the hour would have passed when his labour  would avail him. As he touched the corpse of the  infant the body stirred as if it had sensation. He  shrank back in horror as the fair boy rose gently in  his coffin, and at length stood upright within it.
"Bring back yon bones," said the phantom babe,—"bring  back yon bones; let them rest in peace in  the last home of their fathers. The curse of the  dead will be on you otherwise. Back! back! bring  them back ere it be too late."
The corpse sank down in the coffin again as it  uttered these words, and Ulric saw a skeleton lying  in its place. Shuddering, he averted his gaze, and  turned it towards the chapel door, where he had left  his companion. But, horror upon horror! as he  looked he saw the long, loose, dark outer garment  fall from the limbs of the pilgrim. He saw his form  dilate and expand in height and in breadth, until  his head seemed to touch the pale crescent moon,  and his bulk shut out from view all beyond itself.  He saw his eyes firing and flaming like globes of  lurid light, and he saw his hair and beard converted  into one mass of living flame. The fiend stood  revealed in all his hideous deformity.
His hands were stretched forth to fasten on the  hapless Count, who, with vacillating step, like the  bird under the eye of the basilisk, involuntarily,  though with a perfect consciousness of his awful  situation, and the fearful fate which awaited him,  every moment drew nearer and nearer to him. The  victim reached the chapel door—he felt all the  power of that diabolical fascination—another step  and he would be in the grasp of the fiend who  grinned to clutch him. But the fair boy who spoke  from the grave suddenly appeared once more, and,  flinging himself between the wretched Count and the  door, obstructed his further progress.
"Avaunt, foul fiend!" spake the child, and his  voice was like a trumpet-note; "avaunt to hell! He  is no longer thine. Thou hast no power over him.  Your hellish plot has failed. He is free, and shall  live and repent."
As he said this he threw his arms around Ulric,  and the Count became, as it were, at once surrounded  by a beatific halo, which lighted up the chapel like  day. The fiend fled howling like a wild beast disappointed  of its prey.
The remains of his ancestors were again replaced  in their coffins by the Count, long ere the morning  broke, and on their desecrated graves he poured  forth a flood of repentant tears. With the dawn of  day he quitted the castle of Rheineck. It is said that  he traversed the land in the garb of a lowly mendicant,  subsisting on the alms of the charitable, and it  is likewise told that he did penance at every holy  shrine from Cologne to Rome, whither he was bound  to obtain absolution for his sins. Years afterwards  he was found dead at the foot of the ancient altar  in the ruined chapel. The castle went to ruin, and  for centuries nought ever dwelt within its walls save  the night-birds and the beasts of prey.
Of the original structure the ruins of one old tower  are all that now remain. It is still firmly believed  by the peasants of the neighbourhood, that in the  first and the last quarter of the moon the spirit of  Ulric, the last of the old lords of Rheineck, still  sweeps around the ruin at the hour of midnight, and  is occasionally visible to belated wanderers.
