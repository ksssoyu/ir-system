Story Text:
Long ago, in Dutch Fairy Land, there lived a young mermaid who was very  proud of her good looks. She was one of a family of mere or lake folks  dwelling not far from the sea. Her home was a great pool of water that  was half salt and half fresh, for it lay around an island near the mouth  of a river. Part of the day, when the sea tides were out, she splashed  and played, dived and swam in the soft water of the inland current. When  the ocean heaved and the salt water rushed in, the mermaid floated and  frolicked and paddled to her heart's content. Her father was a  gray-bearded merryman and very proud of his handsome daughter. He owned  an island near the river mouth, where the young mermaids held their  picnics and parties and received the visits of young merrymen.
Her mother and two aunts were merwomen. All of these were sober folks  and attended to the business which occupies all well brought up mermaids  and merrymen. This was to keep their pool clean and nice. No frogs,  toads or eels were allowed near, but in the work of daily housecleaning,  the storks and the mermaids were great friends.
All water-creatures that were not thought to be polite and well behaved  were expected to keep away. Even some silly birds, such as loons and  plovers and all screaming and fighting creatures with wings, were warned  off the premises, because they were not wanted. This family of merry  folks liked to have a nice, quiet time by themselves, without any rude  folks on legs, or with wings or fins from the outside. Indeed they  wished to make their pool a model, for all respectable mermaids and  merrymen, for ten leagues around. It was very funny to see the old daddy  merman, with a switch made of reeds, shooing off the saucy birds, such  as the sandpipers and screeching gulls. For the bullfrogs, too big for  the storks to swallow, and for impudent fishes, he had a whip made of  seaweed.
Of course, all the mermaids in good society were welcome, but young  mermen were allowed to call only once a month, during the week when the  moon was full. Then the evenings were usually clear, so that when the  party broke up, the mermen could see their way in the moonlight to swim  home safely with their mermaid friends. For, there were sea monsters  that loved to plague the merefolk, and even threatened to eat them up!  The mermaids, dear creatures, had to be escorted home, but they felt  safe, for their mermen brothers and daddies were so fierce that, except  sharks, even the larger fish, such as porpoises and dolphins were afraid  to come near them.
One day daddy and the mother left to visit some relatives near the  island of Urk. They were to be gone several days. Meanwhile, their  daughter was to have a party, her aunts being the chaperones.
The mermaids usually held their picnics on an island in the midst of the  pool. Here they would sit and sun themselves. They talked about the  fashions and the prettiest way to dress their hair. Each one had a  pocket mirror, but where they kept these, while swimming, no mortal ever  found out. They made wreaths of bright colored seaweed, orange and  black, blue, gray and red and wore them on their brows like coronets.  Or, they twined them, along with sea berries and bubble blossoms, among  their tresses. Sometimes they made girdles of the strongest and knotted  them around their waists.
Every once in a while they chose a queen of beauty for their ruler. Then  each of the others pretended to be a princess. Their games and sports  often lasted all day and they were very happy.
Swimming out in the salt water, the mermaids would go in quest of  pearls, coral, ambergris and other pretty things. These they would bring  to their queen, or with them richly adorn themselves. Thus the Mermaid  Queen and her maidens made a court of beauty that was famed wherever  mermaids and merrymen lived. They often talked about human maids.
"How funny it must be to wear clothes," said one.
"Are they cold that they have to keep warm?" It was a little chit of a  mermaid, whose flippers had hardly begun to grow into hands, that asked  this question.
"How can they swim with petticoats on?" asked another.
"My brother heard that real men wear wooden shoes! These must bother  them, when on the water, to have their feet floating," said a third,  whose name was Silver Scales. "What a pity they don't have flukes like  us," and then she looked at her own glistening scaly coat in admiration.
"I can hardly believe it," said a mermaid, that was very proud of her  fine figure and slender waist. "Their girls can't be half as pretty as  we are."
"Well, I should like to be a real woman for a while, just to try it, and  see how it feels to walk on legs," said another, rather demurely, as if  afraid the other mermaids might not like her remark.
They didn't. Out sounded a lusty chorus, "No! No! Horrible! What an  idea! Who wouldn't be a mermaid?"
"Why, I've heard," cried one, "that real women have to work, wash their  husband's clothes, milk cows, dig potatoes, scrub floors and take care  of calves. Who would be a woman? Not I"—and her snub nose—since it  could not turn up—grew wide at the roots. She was sneering at the idea  that a creature in petticoats could ever look lovelier than one in  shining scales.
"Besides," said she, "think of their big noses, and I'm told, too, that  girls have even to wear hairpins."
At this—the very thought that any one should have to bind up their  tresses—there was a shock of disgust with some, while others clapped  their hands, partly in envy and partly in glee.
But the funniest things the mermaids heard of were gloves, and they  laughed heartily over such things as covers for the fingers. Just for  fun, one of the little mermaids used to draw some bag-like seaweed over  her hands, to see how such things looked.
One day, while sunning themselves in the grass on the island, one of  their number found a bush on which foxgloves grew. Plucking these, she  covered each one of her fingers with a red flower. Then, flopping over  to the other girls, she held up her gloved hands. Half in fright and  half in envy, they heard her story.
After listening, the party was about to break up, when suddenly a young  merman splashed into view. The tide was running out and the stream low,  so he had had hard work to get through the fresh water of the river and  to the island. His eyes dropped salt water, as if he were crying. He  looked tired, while puffing and blowing, and he could hardly get his  breath. The queen of the mermaids asked him what he meant by coming  among her maids at such an hour and in such condition.
At this the bashful merman began to blubber. Some of the mergirls put  their hands over their mouths to hide their laughing, while they winked  at each other and their eyes showed how they enjoyed the fun. To have a  merman among them, at that hour, in broad daylight, and crying, was too  much for dignity.
"Boo-hoo, boo-hoo," and the merman still wept salt water tears, as he  tried to catch his breath. At last, he talked sensibly. He warned the  Queen that a party of horrid men, in wooden shoes, with pickaxes, spades  and pumps, were coming to drain the swamp and pump out the pool. He had  heard that they would make the river a canal and build a dyke that  should keep out the ocean.
"Alas! alas!" cried one mermaid, wringing her hands. "Where shall we go  when our pool is destroyed? We can't live in the ocean all the time."  Then she wept copiously. The salt water tears fell from her great round  eyes in big drops.
"Hush!" cried the Queen. "I don't believe the merman's story. He only  tells it to frighten us. It's just like him."
In fact, the Queen suspected that the merman's story was all a sham and  that he had come among her maids with a set purpose to run off with  Silver Scales. She was one of the prettiest mermaids in the company, but  very young, vain and frivolous. It was no secret that she and the merman  were in love and wanted to get married.
So the Queen, without even thanking him, dismissed the swimming  messenger. After dinner, the company broke up and the Queen retired to  her cave to take a long nap! She was quite tired after entertaining so  much company. Besides, since daddy and mother were away, and there were  no beaus to entertain, since it was a dark night and no moon shining on  the water, why need she get up early in the morning?
So the Mermaid Queen slept much longer than ever before. Indeed, it was  not till near sunset the next day that she awoke. Then, taking her comb  and mirror in hand, she started to swim and splash in the pool, in order  to smooth out her tresses and get ready for supper.
But oh, what a change from the day before! What was the matter? All  around her things looked different. The water had fallen low and the  pool was nearly empty. The river, instead of flowing, was as quiet as a  pond. Horrors! when she swam forward, what should she see but a dyke and  fences! An army of horrid men had come, when she was asleep, and built a  dam. They had fenced round the swamp and were actually beginning to dig  sluices to drain the land. Some were at work, building a windmill to  help in pumping out the water.
The first thing she knew she had bumped her pretty nose against the dam.  She thought at once of escaping over the logs and into the sea. When she  tried to clamber over the top and get through the fence, her hair got so  entangled between the bars that she had to throw away her comb and  mirror and try to untangle her tresses. The more she tried, the worse  became the tangle. Soon her long hair was all twisted up in the timber.  In vain were her struggles to escape. She was ready to die with fright,  when she saw four horrid men rush up to seize her. She attempted to  waddle away, but her long hair held her to the post and rails. Her  modesty was so dreadfully shocked that she fainted away.
When she came to herself, she found she was in a big long tub. A crowd  of curious little girls and boys were looking at her, for she was on  show as a great curiosity. They were bound to see her and get their  money's worth in looking, for they had paid a stiver (two cents)  admission to the show. Again, before all these eyes, her modesty was so  shocked that she gave one groan, flopped over and died in the tub.
Woe to the poor father and mother at Urk! They came back to find their  old home gone. Unable to get into it, they swam out to sea, never  stopping till they reached Spitzbergen.
What became of the body of the Mermaid Queen?
Learned men came from Leyden to examine what was now only a specimen,  and to see how mermaids were made up. Then her skin was stuffed, and  glass eyes put in, where her shining orbs had been. After this, her body  was stuffed and mounted in the museum, that is, set up above a glass  case and resting upon iron rods. Artists came to Leyden to make pictures  of her and no fewer than nine noblemen copied her pretty form and  features into their coats of arms. Instead of the Mermaid's Pool is now  a cheese farm of fifty cows, a fine house and barn, and a family of  pink-cheeked, yellow-haired children who walk and play in wooden shoes.
So this particular mermaid, all because of her entanglement in the  fence, was more famous when stuffed than when living, while all her  young friends and older relatives were forgotten.
