Story Text:
There was once a woman, who lived in the Camp-del-more of Strathavon,  whose cattle were seized with a murrain, or some such fell disease,  which ravaged the neighbourhood at the time, carrying off great numbers  of them daily.  All the forlorn fires and hallowed waters failed  of their customary effects; and she was at length told by the wise people,  whom she consulted on the occasion, that it was evidently the effect  of some infernal agency, the power of which could not be destroyed by  any other means than the never-failing specific—the juice of a  dead head from the churchyard,—a nostrum certainly very difficult  to be procured, considering that the head must needs be abstracted from  the grave at the hour of midnight.  Being, however, a woman of  a stout heart and strong faith, native feelings of delicacy towards  the sanctuary of the dead had more weight than had fear in restraining  her for some time from resorting to this desperate remedy.  At  length, seeing that her stock would soon be annihilated by the destructive  career of the disease,  the wife of Camp-del-more resolved to put the experiment in practice,  whatever the result might be.  Accordingly, having with considerable  difficulty engaged a neighbouring woman as her companion in this hazardous  expedition, they set out a little before midnight for the parish churchyard,  distant about a mile and a half from her residence, to execute her determination.   On arriving at the churchyard her companion, whose courage was not so  notable, appalled by the gloomy prospect before her, refused to enter  among the habitations of the dead.  She, however, agreed to remain  at the gate till her friend’s business was accomplished.   This circumstance, however, did not stagger the wife’s resolution.   She, with the greatest coolness and intrepidity, proceeded towards what  she supposed an old grave, took down her spade, and commenced her operations.   After a good deal of toil she arrived at the object of her labour.   Raising the first head, or rather skull, that came in her way, she was  about to make it her own property, when a hollow, wild, sepulchral voice  exclaimed, “That is my head; let it alone!”  Not wishing  to dispute the claimant’s title to this head, and supposing she  could be otherwise provided, she very good-naturedly returned it and  took up another.  “That is my father’s head,”  bellowed the same voice.  Wishing, if possible, to avoid disputes,  the wife of Camp-del-more took up another head, when the same  voice instantly started a claim to it as his grandfather’s head.   “Well,” replied the wife, nettled at her disappointments,  “although it were your grandmother’s head, you shan’t  get it till I am done with it.”  “What do you say,  you limmer?” says the ghost, starting up in his awry habiliments.   “What do you say, you limmer?” repeated he in a great rage.   “By the great oath, you had better leave my grandfather’s  head.”  Upon matters coming this length, the wily wife of  Camp-del-more thought it proper to assume a more conciliatory aspect.   Telling the claimant the whole particulars of the predicament in which  she was placed, she promised faithfully that if his honour would only  allow her to carry off his grandfather’s skull or head in a peaceable  manner, she would restore it again when done with.  Here, after  some communing, they came to an understanding; and she was allowed to  take the head along with her, on condition that she should restore it  before cock-crowing, under the heaviest penalties.
On coming out of the churchyard and looking for her companion, she  had the mortification to find her “without a mouthful of breath  in her body”; for, on hearing the dispute between her friend and  the guardian of the grave, and suspecting much that she was likely to  share the unpleasant punishments with which he threatened her friend,  at the bare recital of them she fell down in a faint, from which  it was no easy matter to recover her.  This proved no small inconvenience  to Camp-del-more’s wife, as there were not above two hours to  elapse ere she had to return the head according to the terms of her  agreement.  Taking her friend upon her back, she carried her up  a steep acclivity to the nearest adjoining house, where she left her  for the night; then repaired home with the utmost speed, made dead  bree of the head ere the appointed time had expired, restored the  skull to its guardian, and placed the grave in its former condition.   It is needless to add that, as a reward for her exemplary courage, the  “bree” had its desired effect.  The cattle speedily  recovered, and, so long as she retained any of it, all sorts of diseases  were of short duration.
