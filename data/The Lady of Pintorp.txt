Story Text:
Where to-day a castellate building towers  between spreading parks and gardens on  the noble estate of Eriksberg, there lay in ancient  times a holding known as Pintorp; with which  legend has associated the gruesome tale of the lady  of Pintorp.
In Pintorp—so the legend says—there dwelt a  nobleman who, dying in his youth, left all his goods  and gear to his widow. Yet instead of being a kind  mistress to her many dependents, she exploited  them in every way, and ill-treated them shamefully.  Beneath her castle she had deep subterranean dungeons,  in which languished many innocent people.  She set vicious dogs at children and beggars, and  if any one did not come to work at the right time, he  was sure to go home in the evening with weals on  his back.
Once, early in the morning, when the men came  to work, the Lady of Pintorp was standing on the  castle steps, and saw a poor farm-hand belonging to  the estate come too late. Foaming with rage, she   overwhelmed him with abuse and reproaches, and  ordered him to chop down the largest oak on the  whole estate, and bring it, crown foremost, to the  castle court before evening. And if he did not carry  out her command to the very letter—so she said—she  would drive him from his hut without mercy,  and all that he had should fall to the estate.
With heavy thoughts of the severe judgment  passed upon him, the farm-hand went to the wood;  and there he met an old man who asked him why  he was so unhappy.
"Because it is all up with me, if our Lord in His  mercy do not help me," sighed the unfortunate  man, and told of the task his mistress had imposed  on him.
"Do not worry," said the unknown, "Chop down  this oak, seat yourself on the trunk, and Erik  Gyllenstjerna and Svante Banér will take it to the  castle."
The farm hand did as the old man told him, began  to hew to the line, and sure enough, at the third  stroke the tree fell with a tremendous crash. Then  he seated himself on the trunk, facing the crown,  and at once the tree began to move, as though drawn  by horses. Soon it rushed along so swiftly that  posts and garden-palings flew out of the way like  splinters, and soon they had reached the castle. At  the moment the tree-top struck the castle-gate, one   of the invisible bearers stumbled, and a voice was  heard saying: "What, are you falling on your  knees, Svante?"
The Lady of Pintorp, who was standing on the  steps, knew well who was helping the man; yet instead  of feeling regret, she began to curse and scold,  and finally threatened to imprison the farm-hand.
Then the earth quaked so that the walls of the  castle shook, and a black coach, drawn by two black  horses, stopped before the castle. A fine gentleman,  clad in black, descended from the coach, bowed to  the lady and bade her make ready and follow him.  Trembling—for she knew well who the stranger  must be—she begged for a three years' respite; but  the black gentleman would not grant her request.  Then she asked for three months, and that he refused  as well. Finally she begged for three weeks,  and then for three days; but only three minutes  were allowed her to put her house in order.
When she saw there was no help for it, she begged  that at least her chaplain, her chamber-maid, and  her valet be allowed to accompany her. This request  was granted, and they entered the carriage.  The horses at once started off, and the carriage  drove away so swiftly, that the people at the castle  saw no more than a black streak.
When the woman and her companions had thus  driven a while, they came to a splendid castle, and   the gentleman in black led them up the steps.  Above, in the great hall, the woman laid off her  costly garments and put on a coarse coat and wooden  shoes. Then he combed her hair three times, till  she could no longer bear it, and danced with her  three times until she was exhausted.
After the first dance the Lady begged to be allowed  to give her golden ring to her valet, and it  burned his finger like fire. After the second dance  she gave her chamber-maid her bunch of keys, and  that seared the girl's hand like red-hot iron. But  after the third dance, a trap-door opened in the  floor, and the Lady disappeared in a cloud of smoke  and flame.
The chaplain, who was standing nearest her,  looked down curiously into the opening into which  his mistress had sunk; and a spark shot up from the  depths, and flew into his eye, so that he was blind in  one eye for the rest of his life.
When it was all over, the black gentleman allowed  the servitors to drive home again; but expressly  forbade them to look around. They hastily entered  the coach, the road was broad and even, and the  horses ran rapidly. But when they had gone a  while, the chamber-maid could no longer control her  curiosity, and looked around. That very minute  horses, coach and the road itself were gone, the  travellers found themselves in a wild forest, and   it cost them three years to get out again, and make  their way back to Pintorp.
NOTE
In "The Lady of Pintorp" (Hofberg, p. 157) the devil appears in  all his grewsome Satanic majesty. It has been claimed that the  evil woman was a historical figure, the wife of the royal counselor  Erik Gyllenstjerna.
