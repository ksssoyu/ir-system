Story Text:
Now it chanced many years since that there lived on the Borders a  jolly rattling horse-cowper, who was remarkable for a reckless and fearless  temper, which made him much admired and a little dreaded amongst his  neighbours.  One moonlight night, as he rode over Bowden Moor,  on the west side of the Eildon Hills, the scene of Thomas the Rhymer’s  prophecies, and often mentioned in his history, having a brace of horses  along with him, which he had not been able to dispose of, he met a man  of venerable appearance and singularly antique dress, who, to his great  surprise, asked the price of his horses, and began to chaffer with him  on the subject.  To Canobie Dick, for so shall we call our Border  dealer, a chap was a chap, and he would have sold a horse to the devil  himself, without minding his cloven hoof, and would have probably cheated  Old Nick into the bargain.  The stranger paid the price they agreed  on, and all that puzzled Dick in the transaction was, that the gold  which he received was in  unicorns, bonnet-pieces, and other ancient coins, which would have been  invaluable to collectors, but were rather troublesome in modern currency.   It was gold, however, and therefore Dick contrived to get better value  for the coin than he perhaps gave to his customer.  By the command  of so good a merchant, he brought horses to the same spot more than  once; the purchaser only stipulating that he should always come by night  and alone.  I do not know whether it was from mere curiosity, or  whether some hope of gain mixed with it, but after Dick had sold several  horses in this way, he began to complain that dry bargains were unlucky,  and to hint, that since his chap must live in the neighbourhood, he  ought, in the courtesy of dealing, to treat him to half a mutchkin.
“You may see my dwelling if you will,” said the stranger;  “but if you lose courage at what you see there, you will rue it  all your life.”
Dickon, however, laughed the warning to scorn, and having alighted  to secure his horse, he followed the stranger up a narrow footpath,  which led them up the hills to the singular eminence stuck betwixt the  most southern and the centre peaks, and called, from its resemblance  to such an animal in its form, the Lucken Hare.  At the foot of  this eminence, which is almost as famous for witch-meetings as the neighbouring  windmill of Kippilaw, Dick was somewhat startled to observe that his  conductor entered the  hillside by a passage or cavern, of which he himself, though well acquainted  with the spot, had never seen nor heard.
“You may still return,” said his guide, looking ominously  back upon him; but Dick scorned to show the white feather, and on they  went.  They entered a very long range of stables; in every stall  stood a coal-black horse; by every horse lay a knight in coal-black  armour, with a drawn sword in his hand; but all were as silent, hoof  and limb, as if they had been cut out of marble.  A great number  of torches lent a gloomy lustre to the hall, which, like those of the  Caliph Vathek, was of large dimensions.  At the upper end, however,  they at length arrived, where a sword and horn lay on an antique table.
“He that shall sound that horn and draw that sword,”  said the stranger, who now intimated that he was the famous Thomas of  Ercildoun, “shall, if his heart fail him not, be king over all  broad Britain.  So speaks the tongue that cannot lie.  But  all depends on courage, and much on your taking the sword or horn first.”
Dick was much disposed to take the sword, but his bold spirit was  quailed by the supernatural terrors of the hall, and he thought to unsheathe  the sword first might be construed into defiance, and give offence to  the powers of the mountain.  He took the bugle with a trembling  hand, and blew a feeble  note, but loud enough to produce a terrible answer.  Thunder rolled  in stunning peals through the immense hall; horses and men started to  life; the steeds snorted, stamped, ground their bits, and tossed their  heads; the warriors sprang to their feet, clashed their armour, and  brandished their swords.  Dick’s terror was extreme at seeing  the whole army, which had been so lately silent as the grave, in uproar,  and about to rush on him.  He dropped the horn, and made a feeble  attempt to seize the enchanted sword; but at the same moment a voice  pronounced aloud the mysterious words—
“Woe to the coward, that ever he was born,
              Who did not draw the sword before he blew the horn!”
At the same time a whirlwind of irresistible fury howled through  the long hall, bore the unfortunate horse-jockey clear out of the mouth  of the cavern, and precipitated him over a steep bank of loose stones,  where the shepherds found him the next morning, with just breath sufficient  to tell his fearful tale, after concluding which he expired.
