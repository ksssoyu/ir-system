Story Text:
Thomas, of Ercildoun, in Lauderdale, called the Rhymer, on account  of his producing a poetical romance on the subject of Tristrem and Yseult,  which is curious as the earliest specimen of English verse known to  exist, flourished in the reign of Alexander III. of Scotland.   Like other men of talent of the period, Thomas was suspected of magic.   He was also said to have the gift of prophecy, which was accounted for  in the following peculiar manner, referring entirely to the Elfin superstition.
As Thomas lay on Huntly Bank (a place on the descent of the Eildon  Hills, which raise their triple crest above the celebrated monastery  of Melrose), he saw a lady so extremely beautiful that he imagined she  must be the Virgin Mary herself.  Her appointments, however, were  those rather of an amazon, or goddess of the woods.  Her steed  was of the highest beauty, and at its mane hung thirty silver bells  and nine, which were music to the wind as  she paced along.  Her saddle was of “royal bone” (ivory),  laid over with “orfeverie” (goldsmith’s work).   Her stirrups, her dress, all corresponded with her extreme beauty and  the magnificence of her array.  The fair huntress had her bow in  hand, and her arrows at her belt.  She led three greyhounds in  a leash, and three raches, or hounds of scent, followed her closely.
She rejected and disclaimed the homage which Thomas desired to pay  her; so that, passing from one extremity to the other, Thomas became  as bold as he had at first been humble.  The lady warned him he  must become her slave if he wished to prosecute his suit.  Before  their interview terminated, the appearance of the beautiful lady was  changed into that of the most hideous hag in existence.  A witch  from the spital or almshouse would have been a goddess in comparison  to the late beautiful huntress.  Hideous as she was, Thomas felt  that he had placed himself in the power of this hag, and when she bade  him take leave of the sun, and of the leaf that grew on the tree, he  felt himself under the necessity of obeying her.  A cavern received  them, in which, following his frightful guide, he for three days travelled  in darkness, sometimes hearing the booming of a distant ocean, sometimes  walking through rivers of blood, which crossed their subterranean path.   At length they emerged into daylight, in a most beautiful orchard.   Thomas, almost fainting  for want of food, stretched out his hand towards the goodly fruit which  hung around him, but was forbidden by his conductress, who informed  him that these were the fatal apples which were the cause of the fall  of man.  He perceived also that his guide had no sooner entered  this mysterious ground and breathed its magic air than she was revived  in beauty, equipage, and splendour, as fair or fairer than he had first  seen her on the mountain.  She then proceeded to explain to him  the character of the country.
“Yonder right-hand path,” she says, “conveys the  spirits of the blest to paradise.  Yon downward and well-worn way  leads sinful souls to the place of everlasting punishment.  The  third road, by yonder dark brake, conducts to the milder place of pain,  from which prayer and mass may release offenders.  But see you  yet a fourth road, sweeping along the plain to yonder splendid castle?   Yonder is the road to Elfland, to which we are now bound.  The  lord of the castle is king of the country, and I am his queen; and when  we enter yonder castle, you must observe strict silence, and answer  no question that is asked you, and I will account for your silence by  saying I took your speech when I brought you from middle earth.”
Having thus instructed him, they journeyed on to the castle, and,  entering by the kitchen, found themselves in the midst of such a festive  scene as might become  the mansion of a great feudal lord or prince.
Thirty carcasses of deer were lying on the massive kitchen board,  under the hands of numerous cooks, who toiled to cut them up and dress  them, while the gigantic greyhounds which had taken the spoil lay lapping  the blood, and enjoying the sight of the slain game.  They came  next to the royal hall, where the king received his loving consort;  knights and ladies, dancing by threes, occupied the floor of the hall;  and Thomas, the fatigue of his journey from the Eildon Hills forgotten,  went forward and joined in the revelry.  After a period, however,  which seemed to him a very short one, the queen spoke with him apart,  and bade him prepare to return to his own country.
“Now,” said the queen, “how long think you that  you have been here?”
“Certes, fair lady,” answered Thomas, “not above  these seven days.”
“You are deceived,” answered the queen; “you have  been seven years in this castle, and it is full time you were gone.   Know, Thomas, that the archfiend will come to this castle to-morrow  to demand his tribute, and so handsome a man as you will attract his  eye.  For all the world would I not suffer you to be betrayed to  such a fate; therefore up, and let us be going.”
This terrible news reconciled Thomas to his departure from  Elfinland; and the queen was not long in placing him upon Huntly Bank,  where the birds were singing.  She took leave of him, and to ensure  his reputation bestowed on him the tongue which could not lie.   Thomas in vain objected to this inconvenient and involuntary adhesion  to veracity, which would make him, as he thought, unfit for church or  for market, for king’s court or for lady’s bower.   But all his remonstrances were disregarded by the lady; and Thomas the  Rhymer, whenever the discourse turned on the future, gained the credit  of a prophet whether he would or not, for he could say nothing but what  was sure to come to pass.
Thomas remained several years in his own tower near Ercildoun, and  enjoyed the fame of his predictions, several of which are current among  the country people to this day.  At length, as the prophet was  entertaining the Earl of March in his dwelling, a cry of astonishment  arose in the village, on the appearance of a hart and hind, which left  the forest, and, contrary to their shy nature, came quietly onward,  traversing the village towards the dwelling of Thomas.  The prophet  instantly rose from the board, and acknowledging the prodigy as the  summons of his fate, he accompanied the hart and hind into the forest,  and though occasionally seen by individuals to whom he has chosen to  show himself, he has never again mixed familiarly with mankind.
