Story Text:
Once upon a time there was a man named Kalle  Kula. He was a wild fellow, and had committed  many a grievous crime during his life. When  he came to die, and his wife took up the Bible to pray  for him as he was lying there, he said, "No, this is  Holy Innocents' Day, and it is not worth while reading  from the Bible for me. You had better go into  the kitchen instead, and bake waffles. I shall die  this very day, and then you must lay a bundle of  waffles in my coffin." The woman went into the  kitchen and baked the waffles; but when she came  back to him again he was dead. So Kalle Kula was  laid in the coffin with a bundle of waffles beside him.
Then he came to the gates of Paradise with his  little bundle of waffles under his arm and knocked.  But St. Peter said to him: "You have no business  here, with all the crimes you have committed."  "Yes, that may well be so, but I died on Holy Innocents' Day,"  said Kalle Kula, "so at least I may  look in and see the innocent children?" St. Peter  could not refuse him, and opened the door a little  way. Kalle Kula took advantage of the moment   and cried: "Come, you little holy innocents, you  shall have waffles!" And as they had not been  given any waffles in Paradise, they all came rushing  up, so that the door flew wide open, and then Kalle  Kula crept in.
But St. Peter went to our Lord, told him what  had happened, and asked what was to be done.  "The best thing is to let your lawyer attend to it,"  said our Lord, "because lawyers usually know all  about evicting people." St. Peter searched everywhere,  but could not find a lawyer. Then he went  back to our Lord and reported to him that it was  impossible to find a single lawyer in all Paradise,  and Kalle Kula was allowed to remain where he was.
If you tie a thief and a miller and a lawyer together  and roll the whole bundle down a hill—no  matter how you roll it—you can always be sure that  whoever is on top is a thief.
NOTE
This story, part fairy-tale, part legend, "The Man Who Died on  Holy Innocents' Day" (communicated by Dr. v. Sydow-Lund) has a  Danish variant. Its innocently malicious humor is worthy of  Gottfried Keller.
