Summary:
None

Story Text:
When Confucius came to the earth, the Kilin,  that strange beast which is the prince of all  four-footed animals, and only appears when there is a  great man on earth, sought the child and spat out a jade  whereon was written: “Son of the Watercrystal  you are destined to become an uncrowned king!” And  Confucius grew up, studied diligently, learned wisdom  and came to be a saint. He did much good on earth,  and ever since his death has been reverenced as the  greatest of teachers and masters. He had foreknowledge  of many things. And even after he had  died he gave evidence of this.
Once, when the wicked Emperor Tsin Schi Huang  had conquered all the other kingdoms, and was traveling  through the entire empire, he came to the homeland  of Confucius. And he found his grave. And,  finding his grave, he wished to have it opened and see  what was in it. All his officials advised him not to do  so, but he would not listen to them. So a passage was  dug into the grave, and in its main chamber they  found a coffin, whose wood appeared to be quite fresh.  When struck it sounded like metal. To the left of the  coffin was a door, which led into an inner chamber.  In this chamber stood a bed, and a table with books  and clothing, all as though meant for the use of a living  person. Tsin Schi Huang seated himself on the bed  and looked down. And there on the floor stood two  shoes of red silk, whose tips were adorned with a woven  pattern of clouds. A bamboo staff leaned against the  wall. The Emperor, in jest, put on the shoes, took  the staff and left the grave. But as he did so a tablet  suddenly appeared before his eyes on which stood the  following lines:
Tsin Schi Huang was much alarmed, and had the grave  closed again. But when he reached Schakiu he fell  ill of a hasty fever of which he died.
Note: The Kilin is an okapi-like legendary beast of the most  perfected kindness, prince of all the four-footed animals. The  “Watercrystal” is the dark Lord of the North, whose element is  water and wisdom, for which last reason Confucius is termed his  son. Tsin Schi Huang (B.C. 200) is the burner of books and  reorganizer of China famed in history. Schakiu (Sandhill) was  a city in the western part of the China of that day.
