Summary:
None

Story Text:
Once long ago, before the white man came to Canada, an orphan boy was living alone with his uncle. He was not very happy, for he had to work very hard, and tasks more fitted for a man's shoulders than for a boy's were often placed upon him. When his parents died and left him without brother or sister, his uncle took him to his own home because there was no one else to take care of him. But he treated him very cruelly, and often he wished to get rid of him. No matter how well the boy did his work or how many fish and animals he caught, his uncle was never satisfied, and often he beat the boy harshly and with little cause. 
But the boy was clever and patient, and he decided to endure his hardships as best he could, hoping one day he might escape and find a life where he could use his wit and courage freely.
In a distant village near the sea, there lived a Chief known far and wide for his cruelty. He hated boastfulness and was quick to punish anyone who dared to claim great strength. At this time, three giants arrived in the land and caused great havoc. They destroyed crops, devoured livestock, and stole children. The Chief, desperate, declared, “Whoever rids my land of these monsters shall marry my daughter and inherit my treasure—my most prized traps of silver and bone, used for catching the rarest game.”
The clever boy’s wicked uncle saw this as his chance to get rid of the boy. He took him to the Chief and lied, saying, “This boy claims he can defeat the giants.” The Chief, scowling, told the boy, “If you succeed, the treasure and my daughter are yours. If you fail, you will die.”
Terrified, the boy sat by the sea and wept. Then, from the grey mist, an old woman appeared. She was the Fairy of the Sea and had heard the boy's sorrow. She gave him a knife, a small bear-bladder bag, and three white stones—gifts of great power. “Use them wisely,” she said, “and you shall have victory and the treasure of peace.”
That night, the boy approached the giants’ cave. Following the fairy’s instructions, he hurled the first stone, now heavy as boulders, at the largest giant. Woken in pain, the giant accused his brother of striking him. With the second stone, the same confusion led the angry giant to kill one brother. With the third, he slew the second, believing he had been betrayed. 
When morning came, the clever boy tricked the last giant into thinking he was a lost child. Flattered, the giant spared him and brought him home to serve him. The boy cooked stew for the giant and secretly poured his own portion into the bag. He pretended to eat it, boasting, “In my country, real men eat their stew boiling hot!” The giant, ashamed, gulped it down and burned his throat.
Pretending to suffer from a swollen belly, the boy then stabbed the bag, letting the stew pour out. “It brings relief!” he said. Foolishly, the giant followed suit and stabbed himself—and died.
The boy returned to the Chief with the three stones and the enchanted bag, proof of his cleverness and victory. When the Chief offered his daughter and wealth, the boy replied, “I seek not gold nor marriage, but the treasure of freedom and good tools to hunt.”
Moved by his humility, the Chief gave him the finest traps in the land—silver snares, bone hooks, and sacred nets passed down through generations.
The boy left and settled in a quiet land, where he lived alone with his clever mind and earned great respect. His uncle never saw him again. And from that day, the people spoke of the clever boy who overcame giants not with brute strength, but with wisdom—and earned a treasure greater than gold: freedom, peace, and self-reliance.
