Title: How Smaland and Schonen Came To Be

Summary:
None

Story Text:
The Smalanders declare:
At the time when our Lord created the earth, he  made a level and fruitful stretch of land, and that  was Schonen. But the devil had been busy in the  meantime, and had created Smaland, a barren region  consisting mainly of hills and swamps. When  our Lord saw it, it looked very hopeless to him, and  he strewed the bits of earth that remained in his  apron out over it, and created the Smalanders.  They turned out to be a fine race of men, handsome  and strong and able to take care of themselves in  any situation. It is said to this very day, that if you  take a Smalander and set him down on a rock in  the sea, he will still manage to save himself. But  in the meantime the devil had been down in Schonen,  and had created the people who live there, and that  is why they are so slow, boastful and servile. But  the people of Schonen say:
Once as our Lord and St. Peter were walking  together, they heard a terrible commotion in a  forest. "Go see what is happening there," said   our Lord. St. Peter went. And there was the devil  and a Smalander, who were pummeling each other  with might and main. St. Peter tried to separate  them; but they paid no attention to him. So he  took his sword and chopped off both their heads.  And he told our Lord what he had seen and done:  "No, that was not well done," the latter replied,  "go and put back their heads where they were, and  touch the wounds with your sword, and both will  come to life again." St. Peter did so, but he exchanged  heads. Since that time the Smalanders all  have a bit of the devil about them, and those who  know the devil, will tell you that he is more or less  like the Smalanders.
NOTE
The unfruitful district of Smaland and the lazy and servile people  of Schonen (as retold and communicated by Dr. v. Sydow-Lund),  are supposed to be creative efforts of the devil, at least so the Danes  and Swedes were wont to say, and Selma Lagerl√∂f has repeated it  after them with variants. But the people of Schonen lost no time  in inventing a close relationship between the Smalanders and the  devil.
