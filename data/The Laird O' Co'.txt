Title: The Laird O' Co'

Story Text:
In the days of yore, the proprietors of Colzean, in Ayrshire (ancestors  of the Marquis of Ailsa), were known in that country by the title of  Lairds o’ Co’, a name bestowed on Colzean from some co’s  (or coves) in the rock beneath the castle.
One morning, a very little boy, carrying a small wooden can, addressed  the Laird near the castle gate, begging for a little ale for his mother,  who was sick.  The Laird directed him to go to the butler and get  his can filled; so away he went as ordered.  The butler had a barrel  of ale on tap, but about half full, out of which he proceeded to fill  the boy’s can; but to his extreme surprise he emptied the cask,  and still the little can was not nearly full.  The butler was unwilling  to broach another barrel, but the little fellow insisted on the fulfilment  of the Laird’s order, and a reference was made to the Laird by  the butler, who stated the miraculous capacity of the tiny can, and  received instant orders to fill it if all the ale in the cellar would  suffice.  Obedient to this command, he broached another cask, but  had scarcely drawn  a drop when the can was full, and the dwarf departed with expressions  of gratitude.
Some years afterwards the Laird being at the wars in Flanders was  taken prisoner, and for some reason or other (probably as a spy) condemned  to die a felon’s death.  The night prior to the day for his  execution, being confined in a dungeon strongly barricaded, the doors  suddenly flew open, and the dwarf reappeared, saying—
“Laird o’ Co’,
              Rise an’ go.”
a summons too welcome to require repetition.
On emerging from prison, the boy caused him to mount on his shoulders,  and in a short time set him down at his own gate, on the very spot where  they had formerly met, saying—
“Ae gude turn deserves anither—
              Tak’ ye that for being sae kin’ to my auld mither,”
and vanished.
