Title: The Fox and the Raven

Summary:
None

Story Text:
The fox knows how to flatter, and how to play  many cunning tricks. Once upon a time he  saw a raven, who alighted on a tree with a piece of  meat in his beak. The fox seated himself beneath the  tree, looked up at him, and began to praise him.
“Your color,” he began, “is pure black. This  proves to me that you possess all the wisdom of Laotzse,  who knows how to shroud his learning in darkness.  The manner in which you manage to feed your  mother shows that your filial affection equals that  which the Master Dsong had for his parents. Your  voice is rough and strong. It proves that you have  the courage with which King Hiang once drove his  foes to flight by the mere sound of his voice. In truth,  you are the king of birds!”
The raven, hearing this, was filled with joy and said:  “I thank you! I thank you!”
And before he knew it, the meat fell to earth from  his opened beak.
The fox caught it up, devoured it and then said,  laughing: “Make note of this, my dear sir: if some  one praises you without occasion, he is sure to have  a reason for doing so.”
Note: Traditionally narrated, it may be taken for granted that  this is simply Æsop’s fable in Chinese dress. The manner of presentation  is characteristically Chinese. For “the wisdom of Laotzse”  compare, p. 30, “The Ancient’s Book of Wisdom and Life”: “Who  sees his light, yet dwells in darkness.” Master Dsong was King Dsi’s  most faithful pupil, renowned for his piety. The raven is known in  China as “the bird of filial love,” for it is said that the young ravens  bring forth the food they have eaten from their beaks again, in order  to feed the old birds.
