Story Text:
There was once a Dutchman, who lived in the province called Drenthe.  Because there was a row of little trees on his farm, his name was Ryer  Van Boompjes; that is, Ryer of the Little Trees. After a while, he moved  to the shore of the Zuyder Zee and into Overijssel. Overijssel means  over the Ijssel River. There he bought a new farm, near the village of  Blokzyl. By dyking and pumping, certain wise men had changed ten acres,  of sand and heath, into pasture and land for plowing. They surrounded it  on three sides with canals. The fourth side fronted on the Zuyder Zee.  Then they advertised, in glowing language, the merits of the new land  and Ryer Van Boompjes bought it and paid for his real estate. He was as  proud as a popinjay of his island and he ruled over it like a Czar or a  Kaiser.
A few years before, Ryer had married a "queezel," as the Dutch call  either a nun, or a maid who is no longer young. At this date, when our  story begins, he had four blooming, but old-fashioned children, with  good appetites. They could eat cabbage and potatoes, rye bread and  cheese, by the half peck, and drink buttermilk by the quart. In  addition, Ryer owned four horses, six cows, two dogs, some roosters and  hens, a flock of geese, two dozen ducks, and a donkey.
Yet although Ryer was rich, as wealth is reckoned in Drenthe, whence he  had come, he was greedy for more. He skimped the food of his animals. So  much did he do this, that his neighbors declared that they had seen him  put green spectacles on his cows and the donkey. Then he mixed straws  and shavings with the hay to make the animals think they were eating  fresh grass.
When he ploughed, he drove his horses close to the edge next to the  water, so as to make use of every half inch of land. When sometimes bits  of fen land, from his neighbor's farms, got loose and floated on the  water, Ryer felt he was in luck. He would go out at night, grapple the  boggy stuff and fasten it to his own land.
After this had happened several times, and Ryer had added a half acre to  his holdings, his greed possessed him like a bad fairy. He began to  steal the land on the other side of the Zuyder Zee. In the course of  time, he became a regular land thief. Whenever he saw, or heard of, a  floating bit of territory, he rowed his boat after it by night. Before  morning, aided by wicked helpers, who shared in the plunder, and were in  his pay, he would have the bog attached to his own farm.
All this time, he hardly realized that his ill-gotten property, now  increased to twelve acres or more, was itself a very shaky bit of real  estate. In fact, it was not real at all. His wife one day told him so,  for she knew of her mean husband's trickery.
About this time, heavy rains fell, for many days, and without ceasing,  until all the region was reduced to pulp and the country seemed afloat.  The dykes appeared ready to burst. Thousands feared that the land had an  attack of the disease called val (fall) and that the soil would sink  under the waves as portions of the realm had done before, in days long  gone by.
Yet none of this impending trouble worried Ryer, whose greed grew by  what it fed upon. In fact, the first day the sun shone again, quickly  drying up parts of his farm, he had two horses harnessed up for work.  Then he drove them so near the edge of the ditch that plough, man, and  horses tumbled, and down they went, into the shiny mess of mud and  water.
At this moment, also, the water, from below the bottom of the Zuyder
            Zee, welled up, in a great wave, like a mushroom, and the whole of
            Ryer's soggy estate was on the point of breaking loose and seemed ready
            to float away.
The stingy fellow, as he fell overboard, bumped his head so hard on the  plough beam, that he lay senseless for a half hour. He would certainly  have been drowned, had not Pete, his stout son, who was not far away,  and had seen the tumble, ran to the house, launched a boat and rowed  quickly to the spot, where he had last seen his father. Grabbing his  daddy by the collar, he hauled him, half dead, into the boat. Between  his bump and his fright, and the cold bath, old Ryer was a long time  coming to his wits. With filial piety, Pete kept on rubbing the paternal  hands and restoring the circulation.
All this, however, took a long time, even an hour or more. When his  father was able to sit up and talk, Pete started to row back to the  little wharf in front of his home.
But where was it,—the farm, with the house and fields? Whither had they  gone? Ryer was too mystified to get his bearings, but Pete knew the  points of the compass. Yet his father's farm was not there. He looked at  the shore of Overijssel, which he had left. Instead of the old, straight  lines of willow trees, with the church spire beyond, there was a hollow  and empty place. It looked as if a giant, as big as the world itself,  had bitten out a piece of land and swallowed it down. Dumbfounded,  father and son looked, the one at the other, but said nothing, for there  was nothing to say.
Meanwhile, what had become of the farm and "the Queezel," as the  neighbors still called her—that is, the mother with the children. These  good people soon saw that they were floating off somewhere. The mainland  was every moment receding further into the distance. In fact, the farm  was moving from Overijssel northward, towards Friesland. One by one, the  church spires of the village near by faded from sight.
But when the wind changed from south to west, they seemed as if on a  ship, with sails set, and to be making due west, for North Holland. The  younger children, so far from being afraid, clapped their hands in glee.  They thought it great fun to ferry across the big water, which they had  so long seen before their eyes. Their stingy father had never owned a  carriage, or allowed the horses to be ridden. He always made his family  walk to church. Whether it were to the sermon, in the morning, or to  hear the catechism expounded by the Domine, in the afternoon, all the  family had to tramp on their wooden shoes there and back.
As for the floating farm, the cows could not understand it. They mooed  piteously, while the donkey brayed loudly. At night, and day after day,  no one could attend properly to the animals, to see that they were fed  and given water. One always sees a big tub in the middle of a Dutch  pasture field. Neither ducks, nor geese, nor chickens minded it in the  least, but the thirsty cattle and horses, at the end of the first day,  had drunk the tub dry. None of the dumb brutes, even if they had not  been afraid of being drowned, could drink from the Zuyder Zee, for it  was chiefly sea water, that is, salt, or at least brackish.
Occasionally this errant farm, that had thus broken loose, passed by  fishermen, who wondered at so much land thus adrift. Yet they feared to  hail, and go on board, lest the owners might think them intruding.  Others thought it none of their business, supposing some crazy fellow  was using his farm as a ship, to move his lands, goods and household,  and thus save expense. In some of the villages, the runaway farm was  descried from the tops of the church towers. Then, it furnished a  subject for chat and gossip, during three days, to the women, as they  milked the cows, or knitted stockings. To the men, also, while they  smoked, or drank their coffee, it was a lively topic.
"There were real people on it and a house and stables," said the sexton  of a church, who declared that he had seen this new sort of a flying  Dutchman. It was the usual sight—"cow, dog, and stork," and then he  quoted the old Dutch proverb.
At last, after several days, and when Ryer and his son were nearly  finished, with fatigue and fright, in trying to row their boat to catch  up with the runaway farm, they finally reached a village across the  Zuyder Zee, in North Holland, where rye bread and turnips satisfied  their hunger and they had waffles for dessert. Their small change went  quickly, and then the two men were at their wit's end to know what  further to do.
By this time, out on the floating farm, the mother and children were  wild with fear of starving. All the food for the cattle had been eaten  up, the dog had no meat, the cat no milk, and the stork had run out of  its supply of frogs. There was no sugar or coffee, and neither rye nor  currant-bread, or sliced sausage or wafer-thin cheese for any one; but  only potatoes and some barley grain. Happily, however, in drifting  within sight of the village of Osterbeek, the mother and the children  noticed that the east wind was freshening. Soon they descried the tops  of the church towers of North Holland. The smell of cows and cheese and  of burning peat fires from the chimneys made both animals and human  beings happy, as the wind blew the island westward to the village.
Curiously enough, this was the very place at which, by hard rowing, Ryer  and Pete had also arrived. Father and son were sitting in the hotel  parlor, with their eyes down on the sandy floor, wondering how they were  to pay for their next sandwich and coffee, for their money was all gone.
At that moment, a small boy clattered over the bricks in his klomps. He  kicked these off, at the door, and rushed into the room. He had on his  yellow baggy trousers and his hair, of the same color, was cut level  with his ears. Half out of breath, he announced the coming, afloat, of  what looked like a combination of farm and menagerie. A house, a woman,  some girls, a dog, a cat, and a stork were on it and afloat.
At once, old man Ryer, still stiff from his long, cold bath, hobbled  out, and Pete ran before him. Yes, it was mother, the children and all  the animals! For the first time in his life, the mean old sinner felt  his heart thumping, in grateful emotion, under his woolen jacket, with  its two gold buttons. Something like real religion had finally oozed out  from under his crusted soul.
A whole convoy of boys, fishermen, farmers, and a fat vrouw or two,  volunteered to go out and tow the runaway farm to the village wharf.  They succeeded in grappling the float and held it fast by ropes tied to  a horse post.
That night all were happy. The farm was made fast by another rope put  round the town pump. Then the villagers all went to bed. They were happy  in having rescued a runaway farm, and they expected a good "loon"  (reward) from the rich old Ryer, who, in the barroom, had talked big  about his wealth.
As for the Van Boompjes, in order to save a landlord's bill for beds,  they slept in their house, on board the farm, amid the lowing of their  cattle that called out, in their own way, for more fodder; while the  people in the village wondered at roosters crowing out on the water, and  evidently the barn-yard birds were frightened.
And so they were; for, before midnight, when all other creatures were  asleep, and not even a mouse was stirring on land, whether hard fast, or  floating, the west wind rose mightily and blew to a terrific gale.
In a moment, the tow lines, that held the vagrant farm to the village  pump and horse post, snapped. The Van Boompjes estate left the wharf and  was driven, at a furious rate, across the Zuyder Zee. For several hours,  like a ship under full sail, it was pushed westward by the wind. Yet so  soundly did all sleep, man and wife, children and hens, that none  awakened during this strange voyage. Even the roosters, after their  first concert, held in their voices.
Suddenly, and as straight as if steered by a skilled pilot, the Van  Boompjes farm, now an accomplished traveller, after its many adventures,  shot into its old place. This took place with such violence, that Ryer  Van Boompjes and his wife were both thrown out of bed. The cows were  knocked over in the stable. The dog barked, supposing some one had  kicked him. One old rooster, jostled off his perch, set up a tremendous  crowing, that brought some of the early risers out to rub their eyes and  see what was going on.
"Hemel en aard, bliksem en regen" (Heaven and earth, lightning and  rain), they cried, "the old farm is back in its place."
In fact, the Van Boompjes real estate was snugly fitted once more to the  mainland, and again in the niche it had left. It had struck so hard,  that a ridge of raised sod, five inches high, marked the place of  junction. At least twenty fishes and wriggling eels were smashed in the  collision.
From that day forth the conscience of Van Boompjes returned, and he  actually became an honest man. He sawed off, from time to time, portions  of his big farm, and returned them home, with money paid as interest, to  the owners. He found out all the mynheers, whose bits of land had  drifted off. He sent a tidy sum of gold to the village in North Holland,  where his farm had been moored, for a few hours. With a good conscience,  he went to church and worshipped. His action, at each of the two  collections, which Dutch folks always take up on Sundays, was noticed  and praised as a sure and public sign of the old sinner's true  repentance. When the deacons, with their white gloves on, poked under  his nose their black velvet bags, hung at the end of fishing poles, ten  feet long, this man, who had been for years a skinflint, dropped in a  silver coin each time.
On the farm, all the animals, from duck to stork, and from dog to ox,  now led happier lives. In the family, all declared that the behavior of  the farm and the wind of the Zuyder Zee had combined to make a new man  and a delightful father of old Van Boompjes. He lived long and happily  and died greatly lamented.
