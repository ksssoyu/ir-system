Story Text:
About the middle of the sixteenth century, when  Zündorf was no larger than it is at present, there  lived at the end of the village, hard by the church,  one of that useful class of women termed midwives.  She was an honest, industrious creature, and what  with ushering the new-born into life, and then  assisting in making garments for them, she contrived  to creep through the world in comfort, if not  in complete happiness.
The summer had been one of unusual drought,  and the winter, of a necessity, one of uncommon  scarcity, so that when the spring arrived the good  woman had less to do than at any period in the  preceding seven years. In fact she was totally  unemployed. As she mused one night, lying abed,  on the matter, she was startled by a sharp, quick  knock at the door of her cottage. She hesitated for  a moment to answer the call, but the knocking was  repeated with more violence than before. This  caused her to spring out of bed without more delay,  and hasten to ascertain the wish of her impatient  visitor. She opened the door in the twinkling of  an eye, and a man, tall of stature, enveloped in a  large dark cloak, stood before her.
"My wife is in need of thee," he said to her  abruptly; "her time is come. Follow me."
"Nay, but the night is dark, sir," replied she.  "Whither do you desire me to follow?"
"Close at hand," he answered, as abruptly as  before. "Be ye quick and follow me."
"I will but light my lamp and place it in the  lantern," said the woman. "It will not cost me  more than a moment's delay."
"It needs not, it needs not," repeated the  stranger; "the spot is close by. I know every foot  of ground. Follow, follow!"
There was something so imperative, and at the  same time so irresistible, in the manner of the man  that she said not another word, but drawing her  warm cloak about her head followed him at once.  Ere she was aware of the course he had taken, so  dark was the night, and so wrapt up was she in the  cloak and in her meditations, she found herself  on the bank of the Rhine, just opposite to the low  fertile islet which bears the same name as the  village, and lies at a little distance from the shore.
"How is this, good sir?" she exclaimed, in a  tone of surprise and alarm. "You have missed the  way—you have left your road. Here is no further  path."
"Silence, and follow," were the only words he  spoke in reply; but they were uttered in such a  manner as to show her at once that her best course  was obedience.
They were now at the edge of the mighty stream;  the rushing waters washed their feet. The poor  woman would fain have drawn back, but she could  not, such was the preternatural power exercised  over her by her companion.
"Fear not; follow!" he spoke again, in a kinder  tone, as the current kissed the hem of her garments.
He took the lead of her. The waters opened to  receive him. A wall of crystal seemed built up on  either side of the vista. He plunged into its  depths; she followed. The wild wave gurgled over  them, and they were walking over the shiny pebbles  and glittering sands which strewed the bed of the  river.
And now a change came over her indeed. She  had left all on earth in the thick darkness of a  starless spring night, yet all around her was lighted  up like a mellow harvest eve, when the sun shines  refulgent through masses of golden clouds on the  smiling pastures and emerald meadows of the west.  She looked up, but she could see no cause for this  illumination. She looked down, and her search  was equally unsuccessful. She seemed to herself to  traverse a great hall of surpassing transparency,  lighted up by a light resembling that given out by  a huge globe of ground glass. Her conductor still  preceded her. They approached a little door.  The chamber within it contained the object of  their solicitude. On a couch of mother-of-pearl,  surrounded by sleeping fishes and drowsy syrens,  who could evidently afford her no assistance, lay  the sick lady.
"Here is my wife," spake the stranger, as they  entered this chamber. "Take her in hand at once,  and hark ye, mother, heed that she has no injury  through thee, or——"
With these words he waved his hand, and, preceded  by the obedient inhabitants of the river, who  had until then occupied the chamber, left the  apartment.
The midwife approached her patient with fear  and trembling; she knew not what to anticipate.  What was her surprise to perceive that the stranger  was like any other lady. The business in hand  was soon finished, and midwife and patient began  to talk together, as women will when an opportunity  is afforded them.
"It surprises me much," quoth the former, "to  see such a handsome young lady as you are buried  down here in the bottom of the river. Do you  never visit the land? What a loss it is to you!"
"Hush, hush!" interposed the Triton's lady,  placing her forefinger significantly on her lips;  "you peril your life by talking thus without guard.  Go to the door; look out, that you may see if there  be any listeners, then I will tell something to surprise  you."
The midwife did as she was directed. There  was no living being within earshot.
"Now, listen," said the lady.
The midwife was all ear.
"I am a woman; a Christian woman like yourself,"  she continued, "though I am here now in the  home of my husband, who is the spirit of these  mighty waters."
"God be praised!" ejaculated her auditor.
"My father was the lord of the hamlet of Rheidt,  a little above Lülsdorf, and I lived there in peace  and happiness during my girlish days. I had nothing  to desire, as every wish was gratified by him  as soon as it was formed. However, as I grew to  womanhood I felt that my happiness had departed.  I knew not whither it had gone, or why, but gone  it was. I felt restless, melancholy, wretched. I  wanted, in short, something to love, but that I  found out since. Well, one day a merry-making  took place in the village, and every one was present  at it. We danced on the green sward which  stretches to the margin of the river; for that day I  forgot my secret grief, and was among the gayest of  the gay. They made me the queen of the feast, and  I had the homage of all. As the sun was going down  in glory in the far west, melting the masses of clouds  into liquid gold, a stranger of a noble mien appeared  in the midst of our merry circle. He was garbed in  green from head to heel, and seemed to have crossed  the river, for the hem of his rich riding-cloak was  dripping with wet. No one knew him, no one  cared to inquire who he was, and his presence rather  awed than rejoiced us. He was, however, a stranger,  and he was welcome. When I tell you that  stranger is my husband, you may imagine the rest.  When the dance then on foot was ended, he asked  my hand. I could not refuse it if I would, but I  would not if I could. He was irresistible. We  danced and danced until the earth seemed to reel  around us. I could perceive, however, even in the  whirl of tumultuous delight which forced me onward,  that we neared the water's edge in every successive  figure. We stood at length on the verge of the  stream. The current caught my dress, the villagers  shrieked aloud, and rushed to rescue me from the  river.
"'Follow!' said my partner, plunging as he spoke  into the foaming flood.
"I followed. Since then I have lived with him  here. It is now a century since, but he has communicated  to me a portion of his own immortality,  and I know not age, neither do I dread death any  longer. He is good and kind to me, though  fearful to others. The only cause of complaint I  have is his invariable custom of destroying every  babe to which I give birth on the third day  after my delivery. He says it is for my sake,  and for their sakes, that he does so, and he knows  best."
She sighed heavily as she said this.
"And now," resumed the lady, "I must give you  one piece of advice, which, if you would keep your  life, you must implicitly adopt. My husband will  return. Be on your guard, I bid you. He will  offer you gold, he will pour out the countless treasures  he possesses before you, he will proffer you diamonds  and pearls and priceless gems, but—heed well what  I say to you—take nothing more from him than  you would from any other person. Take the exact  sum you are wont to receive on earth, and take not  a kreutzer more, or your life is not worth a moment's  purchase. It is forfeit."
"He must be a cruel being, indeed," ejaculated  the midwife. "God deliver me from this dread  and great danger."
"See you yon sealed vessels?" spake the lady,  without seeming to heed her fright, or hear her  ejaculations.
The midwife looked, and saw ranged on an upper  shelf of the apartment about a dozen small pots,  like pipkins, all fast sealed, and labelled in unknown  characters.
"These pots," pursued she, "contain the souls of  those who have been, like you, my attendants in  childbirth, but who, for slighting the advice I gave  them, as I now give you, and permitting a spirit of  unjust gain to take possession of their hearts, were  deprived of life by my husband. Heed well what I  say. He comes. Be silent and discreet."
As she spake the water spirit entered. He first  asked his wife how she did, and his tones were like  the rushing sound of a current heard far off. Learning  from her own lips that all was well with her,  he turned to the midwife and thanked her most  graciously.
"Now, come with me," he said, "I must pay thee  for thy services."
She followed him from the sick-chamber to the  treasury of the palace. It was a spacious crystal  vault, lighted up, like the rest of the palace, from  without, but within it was resplendent with treasures  of all kinds. He led her to a huge heap of  shining gold which ran the whole length of the  chamber.
"Here," said he, "take what you will. I put no  stint upon you."
The trembling woman picked up a single piece of  the smallest coin she could find upon the heap.
"This is my fee," she spake. "I ask no more  than a fair remuneration for my labour."
The water spirit's brow blackened like a tempestuous  night, and he showed his green teeth for a  moment as if in great ire, but the feeling, whatever  it was, appeared to pass away as quickly as it came,  and he led her to a huge heap of pearls.
"Here," he said, "take what you will. Perhaps  you like these better? They are all pearls of great  price, or may be you would wish for some memento  of me. Take what you will."
But she still declined to take anything more,  although he tempted her with all his treasures.  She had not forgotten the advice of her  patient.
"I desire nothing more from you, great prince as  you are, than I receive from one of my own condition."  This was her uniform answer to his  entreaties—
"I thank you, but I may not take aught beside  my due."
"If," said he, after a short pause, "you had  taken more than your due, you would have perished  at my hands. And now," proceeded the spirit,  "you shall home, but first take this. Fear  not."
As he spake he dipped his hand in the heap of  gold and poured forth a handful into her lap.
"Use that," he continued, "use it without fear.  It is my gift. No evil will come of it; I give you  my royal word."
He beckoned her onward without waiting for her  reply, and they were walking once again through  the corridors of the palace.
"Adieu!" he said, waving his hand to her,  "adieu!"
Darkness fell around her in a moment. In a  moment more she awoke, as from a dream, in her  warm bed.
