Story Text:
There was once a gentleman that lived in a very grand house, and  he married a young lady that had been delicately brought up.  In  her husband’s house she found everything that was fine—fine  tables and chairs, fine looking-glasses, and fine curtains; but then  her husband expected her to be able to spin twelve hanks o’ thread  every day, besides attending to her house; and, to tell the even-down  truth, the lady could not spin a bit.  This made her husband glunchy  with her, and, before a month had passed, she found hersel’ very  unhappy.
One day the husband gaed away upon a journey, after telling her that  he expected her, before his return, to have not only learned to spin,  but to have spun a hundred hanks o’ thread.  Quite downcast,  she took a walk along the hillside, till she cam’ to a big flat  stane, and there she sat down and grat.  By and by she heard a  strain o’ fine sma’ music, coming as it were frae aneath  the stane, and, on turning it up, she saw a cave below, where there  were sitting six wee  ladies in green gowns, ilk ane o’ them spinning on a little wheel,  and singing,
“Little kens my dame at hame
              That Whippety Stourie is my name.”
The lady walked into the cave, and was kindly asked by the wee bodies  to take a chair and sit down, while they still continued their spinning.   She observed that ilk ane’s mouth was thrawn away to ae side,  but she didna venture to speer the reason.  They asked why she  looked so unhappy, and she telt them that it was she was expected by  her husband to be a good spinner, when the plain truth was that she  could not spin at all, and found herself quite unable for it, having  been so delicately brought up; neither was there any need for it, as  her husband was a rich man.
“Oh, is that a’?” said the little wifies, speaking  out of their cheeks alike.
“Yes, and is it not a very good a’ too?” said the  lady, her heart like to burst wi’ distress.
“We could easily quit ye o’ that trouble,” said  the wee women.  “Just ask us a’ to dinner for the day  when your husband is to come back.  We’ll then let you see  how we’ll manage him.”
So the lady asked them all to dine with herself and her husband,  on the day when he was to come back.
When the gudeman came hame, he found the house  so occupied with preparations for dinner, that he had nae time to ask  his wife about her thread; and, before ever he had ance spoken to her  on the subject, the company was announced at the hall door.  The  six ladies all came in a coach-and-six, and were as fine as princesses,  but still wore their gowns of green.  The gentleman was very polite,  and showed them up the stair with a pair of wax candles in his hand.   And so they all sat down to dinner, and conversation went on very pleasantly,  till at length the husband, becoming familiar with them, said—
“Ladies, if it be not an uncivil question, I should like to  know how it happens that all your mouths are turned away to one side?”
“Oh,” said ilk ane at ance, “it’s with our  constant spin-spin-spinning.”
“Is that the case?” cried the gentleman; “then,  John, Tam, and Dick, fie, go haste and burn every rock, and reel, and  spinning-wheel in the house, for I’ll not have my wife to spoil  her bonnie face with spin-spin-spinning.”
And so the lady lived happily with her gudeman all the rest of her  days.
