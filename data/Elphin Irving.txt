THE FAIRIES’ CUPBEARER.
“The lady kilted her kirtle green
                 A little aboon her knee,
              The lady snooded her yellow hair
                 A little aboon her bree,
              And she’s gane to the good greenwood
                 As fast as she could hie.
And first she let the black steed pass,
                 And syne she let the brown,
              And then she flew to the milk-white steed,
                 And pulled the rider down:
              Syne out then sang the queen o’ the fairies,
                 Frae midst a bank of broom,
              She that has won him, young Tamlane,
                 Has gotten a gallant groom.”
Old Ballad.
“The romantic vale of Corriewater, in Annandale, is regarded  by the inhabitants, a pastoral and unmingled people, as the last border  refuge of those beautiful and capricious beings, the fairies.   Many old people yet living imagine they have had intercourse of good  words and good deeds with the ‘good folk’; and continue  to tell that in the ancient days  the fairies danced on the hill, and revelled in the glen, and showed  themselves, like the mysterious children of the deity of old, among  the sons and daughters of men.  Their visits to the earth were  periods of joy and mirth to mankind, rather than of sorrow and apprehension.   They played on musical instruments of wonderful sweetness and variety  of note, spread unexpected feasts, the supernatural flavour of which  overpowered on many occasions the religious scruples of the Presbyterian  shepherds, performed wonderful deeds of horsemanship, and marched in  midnight processions, when the sound of their elfin minstrelsy charmed  youths and maidens into love for their persons and pursuits; and more  than one family of Corriewater have the fame of augmenting the numbers  of the elfin chivalry.  Faces of friends and relatives, long since  doomed to the battle-trench or the deep sea, have been recognised by  those who dared to gaze on the fairy march.  The maid has seen  her lost lover, and the mother her stolen child; and the courage to  plan and achieve their deliverance has been possessed by, at least,  one border maiden.  In the legends of the people of Corrievale,  there is a singular mixture of elfin and human adventure, and the traditional  story of the Cupbearer to the Queen of the Fairies appeals alike to  our domestic feelings and imagination.
“In one of the little green loops or bends on the banks of  Corriewater, mouldered walls, and a few stunted  wild plum-trees and vagrant roses, still point out the site of a cottage  and garden.  A well of pure spring-water leaps out from an old  tree-root before the door; and here the shepherds, shading themselves  in summer from the influence of the sun, tell to their children the  wild tale of Elphin Irving and his sister Phemie; and, singular as the  story seems, it has gained full credence among the people where the  scene is laid.”
“I ken the tale and the place weel,” interrupted an old  Scottish woman, who, from the predominance of scarlet in her apparel,  seemed to have been a follower of the camp,—“I ken them  weel, and the tale’s as true as a bullet to its aim and a spark  to powder.  O bonnie Corriewater, a thousand times have I pulled  gowans on its banks wi’ ane that lies stiff and stark on a foreign  shore in a bloody grave;” and, sobbing audibly, she drew the remains  of a military cloak over her face, and allowed the story to proceed.
“When Elphin Irving and his sister Phemie were in their sixteenth  year, for tradition says they were twins, their father was drowned in  Corriewater, attempting to save his sheep from a sudden swell, to which  all mountain streams are liable; and their mother, on the day of her  husband’s burial, laid down her head on the pillow, from which,  on the seventh day, it was lifted to be dressed for the same grave.   The inheritance left to the orphans may be briefly  described: seventeen acres of plough and pasture land, seven milk cows,  and seven pet sheep (many old people take delight in odd numbers); and  to this may be added seven bonnet-pieces of Scottish gold, and a broadsword  and spear, which their ancestor had wielded with such strength and courage  in the battle of Dryfe Sands, that the minstrel who sang of that deed  of arms ranked him only second to the Scotts and Johnstones.
“The youth and his sister grew in stature and in beauty.   The brent bright brow, the clear blue eye, and frank and blithe deportment  of the former gave him some influence among the young women of the valley;  while the latter was no less the admiration of the young men, and at  fair and dance, and at bridal, happy was he who touched but her hand,  or received the benediction of her eye.  Like all other Scottish  beauties, she was the theme of many a song; and while tradition is yet  busy with the singular history of her brother, song has taken all the  care that rustic minstrelsy can of the gentleness of her spirit and  the charms of her person.”
“Now I vow,” exclaimed a wandering piper, “by mine  own honoured instrument, and by all other instruments that ever yielded  music for the joy and delight of mankind, that there are more bonnie  songs made about fair Phemie Irving than about all other dames of Annandale,  and many of them are both high and bonnie.  A proud lass maun she  be if her spirit hears;  and men say the dust lies not insensible of beautiful verse; for her  charms are breathed through a thousand sweet lips, and no further gone  than yestermorn I heard a lass singing on a green hillside what I shall  not readily forget.  If ye like to listen, ye shall judge; and  it will not stay the story long, nor mar it much, for it is short, and  about Phemie Irving.”  And, accordingly, he chanted the following  rude verses, not unaccompanied by his honoured instrument, as he called  his pipe, which chimed in with great effect, and gave richness to a  voice which felt better than it could express:—
FAIR PHEMIE IRVING.
Gay is thy glen, Corrie,
                 With all thy groves flowering;
              Green is thy glen, Corrie,
                 When July is showering;
              And sweet is yon wood where
                 The small birds are bowering,
              And there dwells the sweet one
                 Whom I am adoring.
Her round neck is whiter
                 Than winter when snowing;
              Her meek voice is milder
                 Than Ae in its flowing;
              The glad ground yields music
                 Where she goes by the river;
              One kind glance would charm me
                 For ever and ever.
The proud and the wealthy
                 To Phemie are bowing;
              No looks of love win they
                 With sighing or suing;
              Far away maun I stand
                 With my rude wooing,
              She’s a flow’ret too lovely
                 Too bloom for my pu’ing.
Oh were I yon violet
                 On which she is walking;
              Oh were I yon small bird
                 To which she is talking;
              Or yon rose in her hand,
                 With its ripe ruddy blossom;
              Or some pure gentle thought
                 To be blest with her bosom.
This minstrel interruption, while it established Phemie Irving’s  claim to grace and to beauty, gave me additional confidence to pursue  the story.
“But minstrel skill and true love-tale seemed to want their  usual influence when they sought to win her attention; she was only  observed to pay most respect to those youths who were most beloved by  her brother; and the same hour that brought these twins to the world  seemed to have breathed through them a sweetness and an affection of  heart and mind which nothing could divide.  If, like the virgin  queen of the immortal poet, she walked ‘in maiden meditation fancy  free,’ her brother Elphin seemed alike untouched with the charms  of the fairest virgins in Corrie.  He ploughed his field, he reaped  his grain, he leaped, he ran, and wrestled, and danced, and sang, with  more skill and life and grace than all other youths of the district;  but he had no twilight and stolen interviews; when all other  young men had their loves by their side, he was single, though not unsought,  and his joy seemed never perfect save when his sister was near him.   If he loved to share his time with her, she loved to share her time  with him alone, or with the beasts of the field, or the birds of the  air.  She watched her little flock late, and she tended it early;  not for the sordid love of the fleece, unless it was to make mantles  for her brother, but with the look of one who had joy in its company.   The very wild creatures, the deer and the hares, seldom sought to shun  her approach, and the bird forsook not its nest, nor stinted its song,  when she drew nigh; such is the confidence which maiden innocence and  beauty inspire.
“It happened one summer, about three years after they became  orphans, that rain had been for a while withheld from the earth, the  hillsides began to parch, the grass in the vales to wither, and the  stream of Corrie was diminished between its banks to the size of an  ordinary rill.  The shepherds drove their flocks to moorlands,  and marsh and tarn had their reeds invaded by the scythe to supply the  cattle with food.  The sheep of his sister were Elphin’s  constant care; he drove them to the moistest pastures during the day,  and he often watched them at midnight, when flocks, tempted by the sweet  dewy grass, are known to browse eagerly, that he might guard them from  the fox, and lead them  to the choicest herbage.  In these nocturnal watchings he sometimes  drove his little flock over the water of Corrie, for the fords were  hardly ankle-deep; or permitted his sheep to cool themselves in the  stream, and taste the grass which grew along the brink.  All this  time not a drop of rain fell, nor did a cloud appear in the sky.
“One evening, during her brother’s absence with the flock,  Phemie sat at her cottage-door, listening to the bleatings of the distant  folds and the lessened murmur of the water of Corrie, now scarcely audible  beyond its banks.  Her eyes, weary with watching along the accustomed  line of road for the return of Elphin, were turned on the pool beside  her, in which the stars were glimmering fitful and faint.  As she  looked she imagined the water grew brighter and brighter; a wild illumination  presently shone upon the pool, and leaped from bank to bank, and suddenly  changing into a human form, ascended the margin, and, passing her, glided  swiftly into the cottage.  The visionary form was so like her brother  in shape and air, that, starting up, she flew into the house, with the  hope of finding him in his customary seat.  She found him not,  and, impressed with the terror which a wraith or apparition seldom fails  to inspire, she uttered a shriek so loud and so piercing as to be heard  at Johnstone Bank, on the other side of the vale of Corrie.”
An old woman now rose suddenly from her seat in  the window-sill, the living dread of shepherds, for she travelled the  country with a brilliant reputation for witchcraft, and thus she broke  in upon the narrative: “I vow, young man, ye tell us the truth  upset and down-thrust.  I heard my douce grandmother say that on  the night when Elphin Irving disappeared—disappeared I shall call  it, for the bairn can but be gone for a season, to return to us in his  own appointed time—she was seated at the fireside at Johnstone  Bank; the laird had laid aside his bonnet to take the Book, when a shriek  mair loud, believe me, than a mere woman’s shriek—and they  can shriek loud enough, else they’re sair wranged—came over  the water of Corrie, so sharp and shrilling, that the pewter plates  dinneled on the wall; such a shriek, my douce grandmother said, as rang  in her ear till the hour of her death, and she lived till she was aughty-and-aught,  forty full ripe years after the event.  But there is another matter,  which, doubtless, I cannot compel ye to believe: it was the common rumour  that Elphin Irving came not into the world like the other sinful creatures  of the earth, but was one of the kane-bairns of the fairies, whilk they  had to pay to the enemy of man’s salvation every seventh year.   The poor lady-fairy—a mother’s aye a mother, be she elves’  flesh or Eve’s flesh—hid her elf son beside the christened  flesh in Marion Irving’s cradle, and the auld enemy lost his prey  for a time.  Now, hasten on with your story, which  is not a bodle the waur for me.  The maiden saw the shape of her  brother, fell into a faint, or a trance, and the neighbours came flocking  in—gang on with your tale, young man, and dinna be affronted because  an auld woman helped ye wi ’t.”
“It is hardly known,” I resumed, “how long Phemie  Irving continued in a state of insensibility.  The morning was  far advanced, when a neighbouring maiden found her seated in an old  chair, as white as monumental marble; her hair, about which she had  always been solicitous, loosened from its curls, and hanging disordered  over her neck and bosom, her hands and forehead.  The maiden touched  the one, and kissed the other; they were as cold as snow; and her eyes,  wide open, were fixed on her brother’s empty chair, with the intensity  of gaze of one who had witnessed the appearance of a spirit.  She  seemed insensible of any one’s presence, and sat fixed and still  and motionless.  The maiden, alarmed at her looks, thus addressed  her:—‘Phemie, lass, Phemie Irving!  Dear me, but this  be awful!  I have come to tell ye that seven of your pet sheep  have escaped drowning in the water; for Corrie, sae quiet and sae gentle  yestreen, is rolling and dashing frae bank to bank this morning.   Dear me, woman, dinna let the loss of the world’s gear bereave  ye of your senses.  I would rather make ye a present of a dozen  mug-ewes of the Tinwald brood myself; and now I think on  ’t, if ye’ll send over Elphin, I will help him hame with  them in the gloaming myself.  So, Phemie, woman, be comforted.’
“At the mention of her brother’s name she cried out,  ‘Where is he?  Oh, where is he?’ gazed wildly round,  and, shuddering from head to foot, fell senseless on the floor.   Other inhabitants of the valley, alarmed by the sudden swell of the  river, which had augmented to a torrent, deep and impassable, now came  in to inquire if any loss had been sustained, for numbers of sheep and  teds of hay had been observed floating down about the dawn of the morning.   They assisted in reclaiming the unhappy maiden from her swoon; but insensibility  was joy compared to the sorrow to which she awakened.  ‘They  have ta’en him away, they have ta’en him away,’ she  chanted, in a tone of delirious pathos; ‘him that was whiter and  fairer than the lily on Lyddal Lee.  They have long sought, and  they have long sued, and they had the power to prevail against my prayers  at last.  They have ta’en him away; the flower is plucked  from among the weeds, and the dove is slain amid a flock of ravens.   They came with shout, and they came with song, and they spread the charm,  and they placed the spell, and the baptised brow has been bowed down  to the unbaptised hand.  They have ta’en him away, they have  ta’en him away; he was too lovely, and too good, and too noble,  to bless us with his continuance on  earth; for what are the sons of men compared to him?—the light  of the moonbeam to the morning sun, the glowworm to the eastern star.   They have ta’en him away, the invisible dwellers of the earth.   I saw them come on him with shouting and with singing, and they charmed  him where he sat, and away they bore him; and the horse he rode was  never shod with iron, nor owned before the mastery of human hand.   They have ta’en him away over the water, and over the wood, and  over the hill.  I got but ae look of his bonnie blue ee, but ae;  ae look.  But as I have endured what never maiden endured, so will  I undertake what never maiden undertook, I will win him from them all.   I know the invisible ones of the earth; I have heard their wild and  wondrous music in the wild woods, and there shall a christened maiden  seek him, and achieve his deliverance.’  She paused, and  glancing around a circle of condoling faces, down which the tears were  dropping like rain, said, in a calm and altered but still delirious  tone: ‘Why do you weep, Mary Halliday? and why do you weep, John  Graeme?  Ye think that Elphin Irving—oh, it’s a bonnie,  bonnie name, and dear to many a maiden’s heart, as well as mine—ye  think he is drowned in Corrie; and ye will seek in the deep, deep pools  for the bonnie, bonnie corse, that ye may weep over it, as it lies in  its last linen, and lay it, amid weeping and wailing in the dowie kirkyard.   Ye may seek, but ye  shall never find; so leave me to trim up my hair, and prepare my dwelling,  and make myself ready to watch for the hour of his return to upper earth.’   And she resumed her household labours with an alacrity which lessened  not the sorrow of her friends.
“Meanwhile the rumour flew over the vale that Elphin Irving  was drowned in Corriewater.  Matron and maid, old man and young,  collected suddenly along the banks of the river, which now began to  subside to its natural summer limits, and commenced their search; interrupted  every now and then by calling from side to side, and from pool to pool,  and by exclamations of sorrow for this misfortune.  The search  was fruitless: five sheep, pertaining to the flock which he conducted  to pasture, were found drowned in one of the deep eddies; but the river  was still too brown, from the soil of its moorland sources, to enable  them to see what its deep shelves, its pools, and its overhanging and  hazelly banks concealed.  They remitted further search till the  stream should become pure; and old man taking old man aside, began to  whisper about the mystery of the youth’s disappearance; old women  laid their lips to the ears of their coevals, and talked of Elphin Irving’s  fairy parentage, and his having been dropped by an unearthly hand into  a Christian cradle.  The young men and maids conversed on other  themes; they grieved for the loss of the friend  and the lover, and while the former thought that a heart so kind and  true was not left in the vale, the latter thought, as maidens will,  on his handsome person, gentle manners, and merry blue eye, and speculated  with a sigh on the time when they might have hoped a return for their  love.  They were soon joined by others who had heard the wild and  delirious language of his sister: the old belief was added to the new  assurance, and both again commented upon by minds full of superstitious  feeling, and hearts full of supernatural fears, till the youths and  maidens of Corrievale held no more love trysts for seven days and nights,  lest, like Elphin Irving, they should be carried away to augment the  ranks of the unchristened chivalry.
“It was curious to listen to the speculations of the peasantry.   ‘For my part,’ said a youth, ‘if I were sure that  poor Elphin escaped from that perilous water, I would not give the fairies  a pound of hiplock wool for their chance of him.  There has not  been a fairy seen in the land since Donald Cargil, the Cameronian, conjured  them into the Solway for playing on their pipes during one of his nocturnal  preachings on the hip of the Burnswark hill.’
“‘Preserve me, bairn,’ said an old woman, justly  exasperated at the incredulity of her nephew, ‘if ye winna believe  what I both heard and saw at the moonlight end of Craigyburnwood on  a summer night, rank  after rank of the fairy folk, ye’ll at least believe a douce man  and a ghostly professor, even the late minister of Tinwaldkirk.   His only son—I mind the lad weel, with his long yellow locks and  his bonnie blue eyes—when I was but a gilpie of a lassie, he was stolen away from off the horse at his father’s elbow, as they  crossed that false and fearsome water, even Locherbriggflow, on the  night of the Midsummer fair of Dumfries.  Ay, ay, who can doubt  the truth of that?  Have not the godly inhabitants of Almsfieldtown  and Tinwaldkirk seen the sweet youth riding at midnight, in the midst  of the unhallowed troop, to the sound of flute and of dulcimer, and  though meikle they prayed, naebody tried to achieve his deliverance?’
“‘I have heard it said by douce folk and sponsible,’  interrupted another, ‘that every seven years the elves and fairies  pay kane, or make an offering of one of their children, to the grand  enemy of salvation, and that they are permitted to purloin one of the  children of men to present to the fiend—a more acceptable offering,  I’ll warrant, than one of their own infernal brood that are Satan’s  sib allies, and drink a drop of the deil’s blood every May morning.   And touching this lost lad, ye all ken his mother was a hawk of an uncanny  nest, a second cousin of Kate Kimmer, of Barfloshan, as rank a witch  as ever rode on ragwort.  Ay, sirs, what’s bred in the bone  is ill to come out of the flesh.’
“On these  and similar topics, which a peasantry full of ancient tradition and  enthusiasm and superstition readily associate with the commonest occurrences  of life, the people of Corrievale continued to converse till the fall  of evening, when each, seeking their home, renewed again the wondrous  subject, and illustrated it with all that popular belief and poetic  imagination could so abundantly supply.
“The night which followed this melancholy day was wild with  wind and rain; the river came down broader and deeper than before, and  the lightning, flashing by fits over the green woods of Corrie, showed  the ungovernable and perilous flood sweeping above its banks.   It happened that a farmer, returning from one of the border fairs, encountered  the full swing of the storm; but mounted on an excellent horse, and  mantled from chin to heel in a good grey plaid, beneath which he had  the further security of a thick greatcoat, he sat dry in his saddle,  and proceeded in the anticipated joy of a subsided tempest and a glowing  morning sun.  As he entered the long grove, or rather remains of  the old Galwegian forest, which lines for some space the banks of the  Corriewater, the storm began to abate, the wind sighed milder and milder  among the trees, and here and there a star, twinkling momentarily through  the sudden rack of the clouds, showed the river raging from bank to  brae.  As he shook the moisture from his clothes, he was not without  a wish that the day  would dawn, and that he might be preserved on a road which his imagination  beset with greater perils than the raging river; for his superstitious  feeling let loose upon his path elf and goblin, and the current traditions  of the district supplied very largely to his apprehension the ready  materials of fear.
“Just as he emerged from the wood, where a fine sloping bank,  covered with short greensward, skirts the limit of the forest, his horse  made a full pause, snorted, trembled, and started from side to side,  stooped his head, erected his ears, and seemed to scrutinise every tree  and bush.  The rider, too, it may be imagined, gazed round and  round, and peered warily into every suspicious-looking place.   His dread of a supernatural visitation was not much allayed when he  observed a female shape seated on the ground at the root of a huge old  oak-tree, which stood in the centre of one of those patches of verdant  sward, known by the name of ‘fairy rings,’ and avoided by  all peasants who wish to prosper.  A long thin gleam of eastern  daylight enabled him to examine accurately the being who, in this wild  place and unusual hour, gave additional terror to this haunted spot.   She was dressed in white from the neck to the knees; her arms, long  and round and white, were perfectly bare; her head, uncovered, allowed  her long hair to descend in ringlet succeeding ringlet, till the half  of her person was nearly concealed  in the fleece.  Amidst the whole, her hands were constantly busy  in shedding aside the tresses which interposed between her steady and  uninterrupted gaze down a line of old road which wound among the hills  to an ancient burial-ground.
“As the traveller continued to gaze, the figure suddenly rose,  and, wringing the rain from her long locks, paced round and round the  tree, chanting in a wild and melancholy manner an equally wild and delirious  song.
THE FAIRY OAK OF CORRIEWATER.
The small bird’s head is under its wing,
                 The deer sleeps on the grass;
              The moon comes out, and the stars shine down,
                 The dew gleams like the glass:
              There is no sound in the world so wide,
                 Save the sound of the smitten brass,
              With the merry cittern and the pipe
                 Of the fairies as they pass.
              But oh! the fire maun burn and burn,
              And the hour is gone, and will never return.
The green hill cleaves, and forth, with a bound,
                 Comes elf and elfin steed;
              The moon dives down in a golden cloud,
                 The stars grow dim with dread;
              But a light is running along the earth,
                 So of heaven’s they have no need:
              O’er moor and moss with a shout they pass,
                 And the word is spur and speed—
              But the fire maun burn, and I maun quake,
              And the hour is gone that will never come back.
And when they came  to Craigyburnwood,
                 The Queen of the Fairies spoke:
              “Come, bind your steeds to the rushes so green,
                 And dance by the haunted oak:
              I found the acorn on Heshbon Hill,
                 In the nook of a palmer’s poke,
              A thousand years since; here it grows!”
                 And they danced till the greenwood shook:
              But oh! the fire, the burning fire,
            The longer it burns, it but blazes the higher.
“I have won me a youth,” the Elf Queen said,
                 “The fairest that earth may see;
              This night I have won young Elph Irving
                 My cupbearer to be.
              His service lasts but seven sweet years,
                 And his wage is a kiss of me.”
              And merrily, merrily, laughed the wild elves
                 Round Corris’s greenwood tree.
              But oh! the fire it glows in my brain,
              And the hour is gone, and comes not again.
The Queen she has whispered a secret word,
                 “Come hither my Elphin sweet,
              And bring that cup of the charméd wine,
                 Thy lips and mine to weet.”
              But a brown elf shouted a loud, loud shout,
                 “Come, leap on your coursers fleet,
              For here comes the smell of some baptised flesh,
                 And the sounding of baptised feet.”
              But oh! the fire that burns, and maun burn;
              For the time that is gone will never return.
On a steed as white as the new-milked milk,
                 The Elf Queen leaped with a bound,
              And young Elphin a steed like December snow
                 ’Neath him at the word he found.
              But a maiden came, and her christened arms
                 She linked her brother around,
              And called on God,  and the steed with a snort
                 Sank into the gaping ground.
              But the fire maun burn, and I maun quake,
              And the time that is gone will no more come back.
And she held her brother, and lo! he grew
                 A wild bull waked in ire;
              And she held her brother, and lo! he changed
                 To a river roaring higher;
              And she held her brother, and he became
                 A flood of the raging fire;
              She shrieked and sank, and the wild elves laughed
                 Till the mountain rang and mire.
              But oh! the fire yet burns in my brain,
              And the hour is gone, and comes not again.
“O maiden, why waxed thy faith so faint,
                 Thy spirit so slack and slaw?
              Thy courage kept good till the flame waxed wud,
                 Then thy might begun to thaw;
              Had ye kissed him with thy christened lip,
                 Ye had wan him frae ’mang us a’.
              Now bless the fire, the elfin fire,
                 That made thee faint and fa’;
              Now bless the fire, the elfin fire,
              The longer it burns it blazes the higher.”
“At the close of this unusual strain, the figure sat down on  the grass, and proceeded to bind up her long and disordered tresses,  gazing along the old and unfrequented road.  ‘Now God be  my helper,’ said the traveller, who happened to be the laird of  Johnstone Bank, ‘can this be a trick of the fiend, or can it be  bonnie Phemie Irving who chants this dolorous sang?  Something  sad has befallen that makes her seek her seat in this eerie nook amid  the darkness and tempest; through might from aboon  I will go on and see.’  And the horse, feeling something  of the owner’s reviving spirit in the application of spur-steel,  bore him at once to the foot of the tree.  The poor delirious maiden  uttered a yell of piercing joy as she beheld him, and, with the swiftness  of a creature winged, linked her arms round the rider’s waist,  and shrieked till the woods rang.  ‘Oh, I have ye now, Elphin,  I have ye now,’ and she strained him to her bosom with a convulsive  grasp.  ‘What ails ye, my bonnie lass?’ said the laird  of Johnstone Bank, his fears of the supernatural vanishing when he beheld  her sad and bewildered look.  She raised her eyes at the sound,  and seeing a strange face, her arms slipped their hold, and she dropped  with a groan on the ground.
“The morning had now fairly broke; the flocks shook the rain  from their sides, the shepherds hastened to inspect their charges, and  a thin blue smoke began to stream from the cottages of the valley into  the brightening air.  The laird carried Phemie Irving in his arms,  till he observed two shepherds ascending from one of the loops of Corriewater,  bearing the lifeless body of her brother.  They had found him whirling  round and round in one of the numerous eddies, and his hands, clutched  and filled with wool, showed that he had lost his life in attempting  to save the flock of his sister.  A plaid was laid over the body,  which, along with the unhappy maiden in a half-lifeless state, was carried  into a cottage, and  laid in that apartment distinguished among the peasantry by the name  of the chamber.  While the peasant’s wife was left to take  care of Phemie, old man and matron and maid had collected around the  drowned youth, and each began to relate the circumstances of his death,  when the door suddenly opened, and his sister, advancing to the corpse,  with a look of delirious serenity, broke out into a wild laugh and said:  ‘Oh, it is wonderful, it’s truly wonderful!  That bare  and death-cold body, dragged from the darkest pool of Corrie, with its  hands filled with fine wool, wears the perfect similitude of my own  Elphin!  I’ll tell ye—the spiritual dwellers of the  earth, the fairyfolk of our evening tale, have stolen the living body,  and fashioned this cold and inanimate clod to mislead your pursuit.   In common eyes this seems all that Elphin Irving would be, had he sunk  in Corriewater; but so it seems not to me.  Ye have sought the  living soul, and ye have found only its garment.  But oh, if ye  had beheld him, as I beheld him to-night, riding among the elfin troop,  the fairest of them all; had you clasped him in your arms, and wrestled  for him with spirits and terrible shapes from the other world, till  your heart quailed and your flesh was subdued, then would ye yield no  credit to the semblance which this cold and apparent flesh bears to  my brother.  But hearken!  On Hallowmass Eve, when the spiritual  people are let loose on earth for a  season, I will take my stand in the burial-ground of Corrie; and when  my Elphin and his unchristened troop come past, with the sound of all  their minstrelsy, I will leap on him and win him, or perish for ever.’
“All gazed aghast on the delirious maiden, and many of her  auditors gave more credence to her distempered speech than to the visible  evidence before them.  As she turned to depart, she looked round,  and suddenly sank upon the body, with tears streaming from her eyes,  and sobbed out, ‘My brother!  Oh, my brother!’   She was carried out insensible, and again recovered; but relapsed into  her ordinary delirium, in which she continued till the Hallow Eve after  her brother’s burial.  She was found seated in the ancient  burial-ground, her back against a broken gravestone, her locks white  with frost-rime, watching with intensity of look the road to the kirkyard;  but the spirit which gave life to the fairest form of all the maids  of Annandale was fled for ever.”
Such is the singular story which the peasants know by the name of  “Elphin Irving, the Fairies’ Cupbearer”; and the title,  in its fullest and most supernatural sense, still obtains credence among  the industrious and virtuous dames of the romantic vale of Corrie.
