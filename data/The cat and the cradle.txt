Story Text:
In the early ages, when our far-off ancestors lived in the woods, ate  acorns, slept in caves, and dressed in the skins of wild animals, they  had no horses, cows or cats. Their only pets and helpers were dogs. The  men and the dogs were more like each other than they are now.
However, they knew about bees. So the women gathered honey and from it  they made mead. Not having any sugar, the children enjoyed tasting honey  more than anything else, and it was the only sweet thing they had.
By and by, cows were brought into the country and the Dutch soil being  good for grass, the cows had plenty to eat. When these animals  multiplied, the people drank milk and learned to make cheese and butter.  So the Dutch boys and girls grew fat and healthy.
The oxen were so strong that they could pull logs of wood or draw a  plough. So, little by little, the forests were cut down and grassy  meadows, full of bright colored flowers, took their place. Houses were  built and the people were rich and happy.
Yet there were still many cruel men and bad people in the land.  Sometimes, too, floods came and drowned the cattle and covered the  fields with sand, or salt water. In such times, food was very scarce.  Thus it happened that not all the babies born could live, or every  little child be fed. The baby girls especially were often left to die,  because war was common and only boys, that grew into strong warriors,  were wanted.
It grew to be a custom that families would hold a council and decide  whether the baby should be raised or not. But if any one should give the  infant even a tiny drop of milk, or food of any kind, it was allowed to  live and grow up. If no one gave it milk or honey, it died. No matter  how much a mother might love her baby, she was not allowed to put milk  to its lips, if the grandmother or elders forbade it. The young bride,  coming into her husband's home, always had to obey his mother, for she  was now as a daughter and one of the family. All lived together in one  house, and the grandmother ruled all the women and girls that were under  one roof.
This was the way of the world, when our ancestors were pagans, and not  always as kind to little babies as our own mothers and fathers are now.  Many times was the old grandmother angry, when her son had taken a wife  and a girl was born. If the old woman expected a grandson, who should  grow up and be a fighter, with sword and spear, and it turned out to be  a girl, she was mad as fire. Often the pretty bride, brought into the  house, had a hard time of it, with her husband's mother, if she did not  in time have a baby boy. In those days a "Herman," a "War Man" and  "German" were one and the same word.
Now when the good missionaries came into Friesland, one of the first of  the families to receive the gospel was one named Altfrid. With his  bride, who also became a Christian, Altfrid helped the missionary to  build a church. By and by, a sweet little baby was born in the family  and the parents were very happy. They loved the little thing sent from  God, as fathers and mothers love their children now.
But when some one went and told the pagan grandmother that the new baby  was a girl instead of a boy, the old woman flew into a rage and would  have gone at once to get hold of the baby and put it to death. Her  lameness, however, made her move slowly, and she could not find her  crutch; for the midwife, who knew the bad temper of the grandmother, had  purposely hid it. The old woman was angry, because she did not want any  more females in the big house, where she thought there were already too  many mouths to fill. Food was hard to get, and there were not enough war  men to defend the tribe. She meant to get the new baby and throw it to  the wolves. The old grandmother was a pagan and still worshipped the  cruel gods that loved fighting. She hated the new religion, because it  taught gentleness and peace.
But the midwife, who was a neighbor, feared that the old woman was  malicious and she had hid her crutch. This she did, so that if the baby  was a girl, she could save its life. The midwife was a good woman, who  had been taught that the Great Creator loves little girls as well as  boys.
So when the midwife heard the grandmother storm and rave, while hunting  for her crutch, she ran first to the honey jar, dipped her forefinger in  it and put some drops of honey on the baby's tongue. Then she passed it  out the window to some women friends, who were waiting outside. She knew  the law, that if a child tasted food, it must be allowed to live.
The kind women took the baby to their home and fed it carefully. A hole  was drilled in the small end of a cow's horn and the warm milk, fresh  from the cow, was allowed to fall, drop by drop, into the baby's mouth.  In a few days the little one was able to suck its breakfast slowly out  of the horn, while one of the girls held it. So the baby grew bigger  every day. All the time it was carefully hidden.
The foolish old grandmother was foiled, for she could never find out  where the baby girl was, which all the time was growing strong and  plump. Her father secretly made her a cradle and he and the babe's  mother came often to see their child. Every one called her Honig-je', or  Little Honey.
Now about this time, cats were brought into the country and the children  made such pets of them that some of the cows seemed to be jealous of the  attentions paid to Pussy and the kittens. These were the days when cows  and people all lived under one long roof. The children learned to tell  the time of day, whether it was morning, noon or night by looking into  the cats' eyes. These seemed to open and shut, very much as if they had  doors.
The fat pussy, which was brought into the house where Honig-je' was,  seemed to be very fond of the little girl, and the two, the cat and the  child, played much together. It was often said that the cat loved the  baby even more than her own kittens. Every one called the affectionate  animal by the nickname of Dub-belt-je', which means Little Double;  because this puss was twice as loving as most cat mothers are. When her  own furry little babies were very young, she carried them from one place  to another in her mouth. But this way, of holding kittens, she never  tried on the baby. She seemed to know better. Indeed, Dub-belt-je' often  wondered why human babies were born so naked and helpless; for at an age  when her kittens could feed themselves and run about and play with their  tails and with each other, Honig-je' was not yet able to crawl.
But other dangers were in store for the little girl. One day, when the  men were out hunting, and the women went to the woods to gather nuts and  acorns, a great flood came. The waters washed away the houses, so that  everything floated into the great river, and then down towards the sea.
What had, what would, become of our baby? So thought the parents of  Honig-je', when they came back to find the houses swept away and no sign  of their little daughter. Dub-belt-je' and her kittens, and all the  cows, were gone too.
Now it had happened that when the flood came and the house crashed down,  baby was sound asleep. The cat, leaving its kittens, that were now  pretty well grown up, leaped up and on to the top of the cradle and the  two floated off together. Pretty soon they found themselves left alone,  with nothing in sight that was familiar, except one funny thing. That  was a wooden shoe, in which was a fuzzy little yellow chicken hardly  four days old. It had been playing in the shoe, when the floods came  and swept it off from under the very beak of the old hen, that, with all  her other chicks, was speedily drowned.
On and on, the raging flood bore baby and puss, until dark night came  down. For hours more they drifted until, happily, the cradle was swept  into an eddy in front of a village. There it spun round and round, and  might soon have been borne into the greater flood, which seemed to roar  louder as the waters rose.
Now a cat can see sometimes in the night, better even than in the day,  for the darker it becomes, the wider open the eyes of puss. In bright  sunshine, at noon, the inside doors of the cat's eyes close to a narrow  slit, while at night these doors open wide. That is the reason why, in  the days before clocks and watches were made, the children could tell  about the time of day by looking at the cat's eyes. Sometimes they named  their pussy Klok'-oog, which means Clock Eye, or Bell Eye, for bell  clocks are older than clocks with a dial, and because in Holland the  bells ring out the hours and quarter hours.
Puss looked up and saw the church tower looming up in the dark. At once  she began to meouw and caterwaul with all her might. She hoped that some  one in one of the houses near the river bank might catch the sound. But  none seemed to hear or heed. At last, when Puss was nearly dead with  howling, a light appeared at one of the windows. This showed that some  one was up and moving. It was a boy, who was named Dirck, after the  saint Theodoric, who had first, long ago, built a church in the village.  Then Puss opened her mouth and lungs again and set up a regular  cat-scream. This wakened all her other relatives in the village and  every Tom and Kitty made answer, until there was a cat concert of meouws  and caterwauls.
The boy heard, rushed down-stairs, and, opening the door, listened. The  wind blew out his candle, but the brave lad was guided by the sound  which Pussy made. Reaching the bank, he threw off his wooden klomps,  plunged into the boiling waters, and, seizing the cradle, towed it  ashore. Then he woke up his mother and showed her his prize. The way  that baby laughed and crowed, and patted the horn of milk, and kicked up  its toes in delight over the warm milk, which was brought, was a joy to  see. Near the hearth, in the middle of the floor, Dub-belt-je', the  puss, was given some straw for a bed and, after purring joyfully, was  soon, like the baby, sound asleep.
Thus the cat warned the boy, and the boy saved the baby, that was very  welcome in a family where there were no girls, but only a boy. When  Honig-je' grew up to be a young woman, she looked as lovely as a  princess and in the church was married to Dirck! It was the month of  April and all the world was waking to flowers, when the wedding  procession came out of the church and the air was sweet with the opening  of the buds.
Before the next New Year's day arrived, there lay in the same cradle,  and put to sleep over the same rockers, a baby boy. When they brought  him to the font, the good grandmother named him Luid-i-ger. He grew up  to be the great missionary, whose name in Friesland is, even today,  after a thousand years, a household word. He it was who drove out bad  fairies, vile enchanters, wicked spirits and terrible diseases. Best of  all, he banished "eye-bite," which was the name the people gave to  witchcraft. Luid-i-ger, also, made it hard for the naughty elves and  sprites that delude men.
After this, it was easy for all the good spirits, that live in kind  hearts and noble lives, to multiply and prosper. The wolves were driven  away or killed off and became very few, while the cattle and sheep  multiplied, until everybody could have a woollen coat, and there was a  cow to every person in the land.
But the people still suffered from the floods, that from time to time  drowned the cattle and human beings, and the ebb tides, that carried  everything out to sea. Then the good missionary taught the men how to  build dykes, that kept out the ocean and made the water of the rivers  stay between the banks. The floods became fewer and fewer and at last  rarely happened. Then Santa Klaas arrived, to keep alive in the hearts  of the people the spirit of love and kindness and good cheer forever.
At last, when nearly a hundred years had passed away, Honig-je', once  the girl baby, and then the dear old lady, who was kind to everybody and  prepared the way for Santa Klaas, died. Then, also, Dub-belt-je' the  cat, that had nine lives in one, died with her. They buried the old lady  under the church floor and stuffed the pussy that everybody, kittens,  boys, girls and people loved. By and by, when the cat's tail and fur  fell to pieces, and ears tumbled off, and its glass eyes dropped out, a  skilful artist chiselled a statue of Dub-belt-je', which still stands  over the tomb in the church. Every year, on Santa Klaas day, December  sixth, the children put a new collar around its neck and talk about the  cat that saved a baby's life.
