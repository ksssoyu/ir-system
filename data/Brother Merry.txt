Story Text:
In days of yore there was a war, and when it was  at an end a great number of the soldiers that had  been engaged in it were disbanded. Among the  rest Brother Merry received his discharge, and  nothing more for all he had done than a very little  loaf of soldier's bread, and four halfpence in money.  With these possessions he went his way. Now a  saint had seated himself in the road, like a poor  beggar man, and when Brother Merry came along,  he asked him for charity to give him something.  Then the soldier said—
"Dear beggar man, what shall such as I give  you? I have been a soldier, and have just got my  discharge, and with it only a very little loaf  and four halfpence. When that is gone I shall  have to beg like yourself."
However, he divided the loaf into four parts, and  gave the saint one, with a halfpenny. The saint  thanked him, and having gone a little further along  the road seated himself like another beggar in the  way of the soldier. When Brother Merry came up  the saint again asked alms of him, and the old  soldier again gave him another quarter of the loaf  and another halfpenny.
The saint thanked him, and seated himself in the  way a third time, like another beggar, and again addressed  Brother Merry. Brother Merry gave him  a third quarter of the loaf, and the third halfpenny.
The saint thanked him, and Brother Merry journeyed  on with all he had left—one quarter of the  loaf and a single halfpenny. When he came to a  tavern, being hungry and thirsty, he went in and  ate the bread, and spent the halfpenny in beer to  drink with it. When he had finished, he continued  his journey, and the saint, in the disguise of a disbanded  soldier, met him again and saluted him.
"Good day, comrade," said he; "can you give me  a morsel of bread, and a halfpenny to get a drop  of drink?"
"Where shall I get it?" answered Brother  Merry. "I got my discharge, and nothing with it  but a loaf and four halfpence, and three beggars  met me on the road and I gave each of them a  quarter of the loaf and a halfpenny. The last  quarter I have just eaten at the tavern, and I have  spent the last halfpenny in drink. I am quite  empty now. If you have nothing, let us go begging  together."
"No, that will not be necessary just now," said  the saint. "I understand a little about doctoring,  and I will in time obtain as much as I need by  that."
"Ha!" said Brother Merry, "I know nothing  about that, so I must go and beg by myself."
"Only come along," replied the saint, "and if I  can earn anything, you shall go halves."
"That will suit me excellently," replied Brother  Merry.
So they travelled on together.
They had not gone a great distance before they  came to a cottage in which they heard a great  lamenting and screaming. They went in to see  what was the matter, and found a man sick to the  death, as if about to expire, and his wife crying  and weeping loudly.
"Leave off whining and crying," said the saint.  "I will make the man well again quickly enough,"  and he took a salve out of his pocket and cured the  man instantly, so that he could stand up and was  quite hearty. Then the man and his wife, in great  joy, demanded—
"How can we repay you? What shall we give  you?"
The saint would not, however, take anything,  and the more the couple pressed him the more  firmly he declined. Brother Merry, who had been  looking on, came to his side, and, nudging him, said—
"Take something; take something. We want it  badly enough."
At length the peasant brought a lamb, which  he desired the saint to accept, but he declined  it still. Then Brother Merry jogged his side, and  said—
"Take it, you foolish fellow; take it. We want  it badly enough."
At last the saint said—
"Well, I'll take the lamb, but I shall not carry  it. You must carry it."
"There's no great hardship in that," cried Brother  Merry. "I can easily do it;" and he took it on  his shoulder.
After that they went on till they came to a  wood, and Brother Merry, who was very hungry,  and found the lamb a heavy load, called out to  the saint—
"Hallo! here is a nice place for us to dress and  eat the lamb."
"With all my heart," replied his companion;  "but I don't understand anything of cooking, so do  you begin, and I will walk about until it is ready.  Don't begin to eat until I return. I will take care  to be back in time."
"Go your ways," said Brother Merry; "I can  cook it well enough. I'll soon have it ready."
The saint wandered away, while Brother Merry  lighted the fire, killed the lamb, put the pieces  into the pot, and boiled them. In a short time the  lamb was thoroughly done, but the saint had not  returned; so Merry took the meat up, carved it,  and found the heart.
"That is the best part of it," said he; and he  kept tasting it until he had finished it.
At length the saint came back, and said—
"I only want the heart. All the rest you may  have, only give me that."
Then Brother Merry took his knife and fork, and  turned the lamb about as if he would have found  the heart, but of course he could not discover it.  At last he said, in a careless manner—
"It is not here."
"Not there? Where should it be, then?" said  the saint.
"That I don't know," said Merry; "but now I  think of it, what a couple of fools we are to look  for the heart of a lamb. A lamb, you know, has  not got a heart."
"What?" said the saint; "that's news, indeed.  Why, every beast has a heart, and why should not  the lamb have one as well as the rest of them?"
"No, certainly, comrade, a lamb has no heart.  Only reflect, and it will occur to you that it really  has not."
"Well," replied his companion, "it is quite sufficient.  There is no heart there, so I need none of  the lamb. You may eat it all."
"Well, what I cannot eat I'll put in my knapsack,"  said Brother Merry.
Then he ate some, and disposed of the rest as he  had said. Now, as they continued their journey,  the saint contrived that a great stream should flow  right across their path, so that they must be  obliged to ford it. Then said he—
"Go you first."
"No," answered Brother Merry; "go you first,"  thinking that if the water were too deep he would  stay on the bank where he was. However, the  saint waded through, and the water only reached  to his knees; but when Brother Merry ventured,  the stream seemed suddenly to increase  in depth, and he was soon up to his neck in the  water.
"Help me, comrade," he cried.
"Will you confess," said the saint, "that you ate  the lamb's heart?"
The soldier still denied it, and the water got still  deeper, until it reached his mouth. Then the saint  said again—
"Will you confess, then, that you ate the lamb's  heart?"
Brother Merry still denied what he had done,  and as the saint did not wish to let him drown he  helped him out of his danger.
They journeyed on until they came to a kingdom  where they heard that the king's daughter lay  dangerously ill.
"Holloa! brother," said the soldier, "here's a  catch for us. If we can only cure her we shall be  made for ever."
The saint, however, was not quick enough for  Brother Merry.
"Come, Brother Heart," said the soldier, "put  your best foot forward, so that we may come in at  the right time."
But the saint went still slower, though his companion  kept pushing and driving him, till at last  they heard that the princess was dead.
"This comes of your creeping so," said the  soldier.
"Now be still," said the saint, "for I can do  more than make the sick whole; I can bring the  dead to life again."
"If that's true," said Brother Merry, "you must  at least earn half the kingdom for us."
At length they arrived at the king's palace,  where everybody was in great trouble, but the saint  told the king he would restore his daughter to him.  They conducted him to where she lay, and he commanded  them to let him have a caldron of water,  and when it had been brought, he ordered all the  people to go away, and let nobody remain with him  but Brother Merry. Then he divided the limbs of  the dead princess, and throwing them into the water,  lighted a fire under the caldron, and boiled them.  When all the flesh had fallen from the bones, the  saint took them, laid them on a table, and placed  them together in their natural order. Having done  this, he walked before them, and said—
"Arise, thou dead one!"
As he repeated these words the third time the  princess arose, alive, well, and beautiful.
The king was greatly rejoiced, and said to the  saint—
"Require for thy reward what thou wilt.  Though it should be half my empire, I will give  it you."
But the saint replied—
"I desire nothing for what I have done."
"O thou Jack Fool!" thought Brother Merry  to himself. Then, nudging his comrade's side, he  said—
"Don't be so silly. If you won't have anything,  yet I need somewhat."
The saint, however, would take nothing, but as  the king saw that his companion would gladly have  a gift, he commanded the keeper of his treasures to  fill his knapsack with gold, at which Brother Merry  was right pleased.
Again they went upon their way till they came  to a wood, when the saint said to his fellow-traveller—
"Now we will share the gold."
"Yes," replied the soldier, "that we can."
Then the saint took the gold and divided it into  three portions.
"Well," thought Brother Merry, "what whim  has he got in his head now, making three parcels,  and only two of us?"
"Now," said the saint, "I have divided it fairly,  one for me, and one for you, and one for him who  ate the heart."
"Oh, I ate that," said the soldier, quickly taking  up the gold. "I did, I assure you."
"How can that be true?" replied the saint. "A  lamb has no heart."
"Ay! what, brother? What are you thinking  of? A lamb has no heart? Very good! When  every beast has why should that one be without?"
"Now that is very good," said the saint. "Take  all the gold yourself, for I shall remain no more  with you, but will go my own way alone."
"As you please, Brother Heart," answered the  soldier. "A pleasant journey to you, my hearty."
The saint took another road, and as he went  off—
"Well," thought the soldier, "it's all right that  he has marched off, for he is an odd fellow."
Brother Merry had now plenty of money, but he  did not know how to use it, so he spent it and gave  it away, till in the course of a little time he found  himself once more penniless. At last he came into  a country where he heard that the king's daughter  was dead.
"Ah!" thought he, "that may turn out well.  I'll bring her to life again."
Then he went to the king and offered his services.  Now the king had heard that there was an old  soldier who went about restoring the dead to life,  and he thought that Brother Merry must be just  the man. However, he had not much confidence  in him, so he first consulted his council, and they  agreed that as the princess was certainly dead, the  old soldier might be allowed to see what he could  do. Brother Merry commanded them to bring him  a caldron of water, and when every one had left  the room he separated the limbs, threw them into  the caldron, and made a fire under it, exactly as  he had seen the saint do. When the water boiled  and the flesh fell from the bones, he took them and  placed them upon the table, but as he did not know  how to arrange them he piled them one upon another.  Then he stood before them, and said—
"Thou dead, arise!" and he cried so three times,  but all to no purpose.
"Stand up, you vixen! stand up, or it shall be  the worse for you," he cried.
Scarcely had he repeated these words ere the  saint came in at the window, in the likeness of an  old soldier, just as before, and said—
"You impious fellow! How can the dead stand  up when you have thrown the bones thus one upon  another?"
"Ah! Brother Heart," answered Merry, "I have  done it as well as I can."
"I will help you out of your trouble this time,"  said the saint; "but I tell you this, if you ever  again undertake a job of this kind, you will repent  it, and for this you shall neither ask for nor take  the least thing from the king."
Having placed the bones in their proper order,  the saint said three times—
"Thou dead, arise!" and the princess stood up,  sound and beautiful as before. Then the saint  immediately disappeared again out of the window,  and Brother Merry was glad that all had turned out  so well. One thing, however, grieved him sorely, and  that was that he might take nothing from the king.
"I should like to know," thought he, "what  Brother Heart had to grumble about. What he  gives with one hand he takes with the other. There  is no wit in that."
The king asked Brother Merry what he would  have, but the soldier durst not take anything.  However, he managed by hints and cunning that the  king should fill his knapsack with money, and with  that he journeyed on. When he came out of the  palace door, however, he found the saint standing  there, who said—
"See what a man you are. Have I not forbidden  you to take anything, and yet you have your knapsack  filled with gold?"
"How can I help it," answered the soldier, "if  they would thrust it in?"
"I tell you this," said the saint, "mind that you  don't undertake such a business a second time. If  you do, it will fare badly with you."
"Ah! brother," answered the soldier, "never fear.  Now I have money, why should I trouble myself  with washing bones?"
"That will not last a long time," said the saint;  "but, in order that you may never tread in a forbidden  path, I will bestow upon your knapsack this  power, that whatsoever you wish in it shall be there.  Farewell! you will never see me again."
"Adieu," said Brother Merry, and thought he,  "I am glad you are gone. You are a wonderful  fellow. I am willing enough not to follow you."
He forgot all about the wonderful property  bestowed upon his knapsack, and very soon he had  spent and squandered his gold as before. When he  had but fourpence left, he came to a public-house,  and thought that the money must go. So he called  for three pennyworth of wine and a pennyworth of  bread. As he ate and drank, the flavour of roasting  geese tickled his nose, and, peeping and prying  about, he saw that the landlord had placed two geese  in the oven. Then it occurred to him what his  companion had told him about his knapsack, so he  determined to put it to the test. Going out, he  stood before the door, and said—
"I wish that the two geese which are baking in  the oven were in my knapsack."
When he had said this, he peeped in, and, sure  enough, there they were.
"Ah! ah!" said he, "that is all right. I am a  made man."
He went on a little way, took out the geese, and  commenced to eat them. As he was thus enjoying  himself, there came by two labouring men, who  looked with hungry eyes at the one goose which was  yet untouched. Brother Merry noticed it, and  thought that one goose would be enough for him.  So he called the men, gave them the goose, and bade  them drink his health. The men thanked him, and  going to the public-house, called for wine and bread,  took out their present, and commenced to eat.  When the hostess saw what they were dining on,  she said to her goodman—
"Those two men are eating a goose. You had  better see if it is not one of ours out of the oven."
The host opened the door, and lo! the oven was  empty.
"O you pack of thieves!" he shouted. "This  is the way you eat geese, is it? Pay for them  directly, or I will wash you both with green hazel  juice."
The men said—
"We are not thieves. We met an old soldier on  the road, and he made us a present of the goose."
"You are not going to hoax me in that way,"  said the host. "The soldier has been here, but  went out of the door like an honest fellow. I  took care of that. You are the thieves, and you  shall pay for the geese."
However, as the men had no money to pay  him with, he took a stick and beat them out of  doors.
Meanwhile, as Brother Merry journeyed on, he  came to a place where there was a noble castle, and  not far from it a little public-house. Into this he  went, and asked for a night's lodging, but the landlord  said that his house was full of guests, and he  could not accommodate him.
"I wonder," said Brother Merry, "that the people  should all come to you, instead of going to that  castle."
"They have good reason for what they do," said  the landlord, "for whoever has attempted to spend  the night at the castle has never come back to show  how he was entertained."
"If others have attempted it, why shouldn't I?"  said Merry.
"You had better leave it alone," said the host;  "you are only thrusting your head into danger."
"No fear of danger," said the soldier, "only give  me the key and plenty to eat and drink."
The hostess gave him what he asked for, and he  went off to the castle, relished his supper, and when  he found himself sleepy, laid himself down on the  floor, for there was no bed in the place. He soon  went to sleep, but in the night he was awoke by a  great noise, and when he aroused himself he discovered  nine very ugly devils dancing in a circle  which they had made around him.
"Dance as long as you like," said Brother Merry;  "but don't come near me."
But the devils came drawing nearer and nearer,  and at last they almost trod on his face with their  misshapen feet.
"Be quiet," said he, but they behaved still worse.
At last he got angry, and crying—
"Holla! I'll soon make you quiet," he caught  hold of the leg of a stool and struck about  him.
Nine devils against one soldier were, however,  too much, and while he laid about lustily on those  before him, those behind pulled his hair and pinched  him miserably.
"Ay, ay, you pack of devils, now you are too  hard for me," said he; "but wait a bit. I wish all  the nine devils were in my knapsack," cried he, and  it was no sooner said than done.
There they were. Then Brother Merry buckled  it up close, and threw it into a corner, and as all  was now still he lay down and slept till morning,  when the landlord of the inn and the nobleman to  whom the castle belonged came to see how it had  fared with him. When they saw him sound and  lively, they were astonished, and said—
"Did the ghosts, then, do nothing to you?"
"Why, not exactly," said Merry; "but I have  got them all nine in my knapsack. You may dwell  quietly enough in your castle now; from henceforth  they won't trouble you."
The nobleman thanked him and gave him great  rewards, begging him to remain in his service, saying  that he would take care of him all the days of  his life.
"No," answered he; "I am used to wander and  rove about. I will again set forth."
He went on until he came to a smithy, into  which he went, and laying his knapsack on the  anvil, bade the smith and all his men hammer away  upon it as hard as they could. They did as they  were directed, with their largest hammers and all  their might, and the poor devils set up a piteous  howling. When the men opened the knapsack  there were eight of them dead, but one who had  been snug in a fold was still alive, and he slipped  out and ran away to his home in a twinkling.
After this Brother Merry wandered about the world  for a long time; but at last he grew old, and began  to think about his latter end, so he went to a hermit  who was held to be a very pious man and said—
"I am tired of roving, and will now endeavour to  go to heaven."
"There stand two ways," said the hermit; "the  one, broad and pleasant, leads to hell; the other  is rough and narrow, and that leads to heaven."
"I must be a fool indeed," thought Brother Merry,  "if I go the rough and narrow road;" so he went the  broad and pleasant way till he came at last to a  great black door, and that was the door of hell.
He knocked, and the door-keeper opened it, and  when he saw that it was Merry he was sadly  frightened, for who should he be but the ninth devil  who had been in the knapsack, and he had thought  himself lucky, for he had escaped with nothing worse  than a black eye. He bolted the door again directly,  and running to the chief of the devils, said—
"There is a fellow outside with a knapsack on  his back, but pray don't let him in, for he can get  all hell into his knapsack by wishing it. He once  got me a terribly ugly hammering in it."
So they called out to Brother Merry, and told  him that he must go away, for they should not let  him in.
"Well, if they will not have me here," thought  Merry, "I'll e'en try if I can get a lodging in heaven.  Somewhere or other I must rest."
So he turned about and went on till he came to  the door of heaven, and there he knocked. Now  the saint who had journeyed with Merry sat at the  door, and had charge of the entrance. Brother Merry  recognised him, and said—
"Are you here, old acquaintance? Then things  will go better with me."
The saint replied—
"I suppose you want to get into heaven?"
"Ay, ay, brother, let me in; I must put up  somewhere."
"No," said the saint; "you don't come in here."
"Well, if you won't let me in, take your dirty  knapsack again. I'll have nothing that can put me  in mind of you," said Merry carelessly.
"Give it me, then," said the saint.
Brother Merry handed it through the grating  into heaven, and the saint took it and hung it up  behind his chair.
"Now," said Brother Merry, "I wish I was in  my own knapsack."
Instantly he was there; and thus, being once  actually in heaven, the saint was obliged to let him  stay there.
