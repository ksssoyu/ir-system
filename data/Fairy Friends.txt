Story Text:
It is a good thing to befriend the fairies, as the following stories  show:—
There have been from time immemorial at Hawick, during the two or  three last weeks of the year, markets once a week, for the disposal  of sheep for slaughter, at which the greater number of people, both  in the middle and poorer classes of life, have been accustomed to provide  themselves with their marts.  A poor man from Jedburgh who  was on his way to Hawick for the purpose of attending one of these markets,  as he was passing over that side of Rubislaw which is nearest the Teviot,  was suddenly alarmed by a frightful and unaccountable noise.  The  sound, as he supposed, proceeded from an immense number of female voices,  but no objects whence it could come were visible.  Amidst howling  and wailing were mixed shouts of mirth and jollity, but he could gather  nothing articulate except the following words—
“O there’s a bairn born, but there’s naething to  pit on ’t.”
The occasion of  this elfish concert, it seemed, was the birth of a fairy child, at which  the fairies, with the exception of two or three who were discomposed  at having nothing to cover the little innocent with, were enjoying themselves  with that joviality usually characteristic of such an event.  The  astonished rustic finding himself amongst a host of invisible beings,  in a wild moorland place, and far from any human assistance, should  assistance be required, full of the greatest consternation, immediately  on hearing this expression again and again vociferated, stripped off  his plaid, and threw it on the ground.  It was instantly snatched  up by an invisible hand, and the wailings immediately ceased, but the  shouts of mirth were continued with increased vigour.  Being of  opinion that what he had done had satisfied his invisible friends, he  lost no time in making off, and proceeded on his road to Hawick, musing  on his singular adventure.  He purchased a sheep, which turned  out a remarkably good bargain, and returned to Jedburgh.  He had  no cause to regret his generosity in bestowing his plaid on the fairies,  for every day afterwards his wealth multiplied, and he continued till  the day of his death a rich and prosperous man.

About the beginning of harvest, there having been a want of meal  for shearers’ bread in the farmhouse of Bedrule, a small  quantity of barley (being all that  was yet ripe) was cut down, and converted into meal.  Mrs. Buckham,  the farmer’s wife, rose early in the morning to bake the bread,  and, while she was engaged in baking, a little woman in green costume  came in, and, with much politeness, asked for a loan of a capful of  meal.  Mrs. Buckham thought it prudent to comply with her request.   In a short time afterwards the woman in green returned with an equal  quantity of meal, which Mrs. Buckham put into the meal-ark.   This meal had such a lasting quality, that from it alone the gudewife  of Bedrule baked as much bread as served her own family and the reapers  throughout the harvest, and when harvest was over it was not exhausted.
