Story Text:
Of mermen and merwomen many strange stories are told in the Shetland  Isles.  Beneath the depths of the ocean, according to these stories,  an atmosphere exists adapted to the respiratory organs of certain beings,  resembling, in form, the human race, possessed of surpassing beauty,  of limited supernatural powers, and liable to the incident of death.   They dwell in a wide territory of the globe, far below the region of  fishes, over which the sea, like the cloudy canopy of our sky, loftily  rolls, and they possess habitations constructed of the pearl and coral  productions of the ocean.  Having lungs not adapted to a watery  medium, but to the nature of atmospheric air, it would be impossible  for them to pass through the volume of waters that intervenes between  the submarine and supramarine world, if it were not for the extraordinary  power they inherit of entering the skin of some animal capable of existing  in the sea, which they are enabled to occupy by a sort of demoniacal  possession.  One shape they put on, is that of an animal human  above the waist, yet  terminating below in the tail and fins of a fish, but the most favourite  form is that of the larger seal or Haaf-fish; for, in possessing an  amphibious nature, they are enabled not only to exist in the ocean,  but to land on some rock, where they frequently lighten themselves of  their sea-dress, resume their proper shape, and with much curiosity  examine the nature of the upper world belonging to the human race.   Unfortunately, however, each merman or merwoman possesses but one skin,  enabling the individual to ascend the seas, and if, on visiting the  abode of man, the garb be lost, the hapless being must unavoidably become  an inhabitant of the earth.
A story is told of a boat’s crew who landed for the purpose  of attacking the seals lying in the hollows of the crags at one of the  stacks.  The men stunned a number of the animals, and while they  were in this state stripped them of their skins, with the fat attached  to them.  Leaving the carcasses on the rock, the crew were about  to set off for the shore of Papa Stour, when such a tremendous swell  arose that every one flew quickly to the boat.  All succeeded in  entering it except one man, who had imprudently lingered behind.   The crew were unwilling to leave a companion to perish on the skerries,  but the surge increased so fast, that after many unsuccessful attempts  to bring the boat close in to the stack the unfortunate wight was left  to his fate.  A stormy night came on, and the deserted Shetlander  saw no prospect before him but that of perishing from cold and hunger,  or of being washed into the sea by the breakers which threatened to  dash over the rocks.  At length, he perceived many of the seals,  who, in their flight had escaped the attack of the boatmen, approach  the skerry, disrobe themselves of their amphibious hides, and resume  the shape of the sons and daughters of the ocean.  Their first  object was to assist in the recovery of their friends, who having been  stunned by clubs, had, while in that state, been deprived of their skins.   When the flayed animals had regained their sensibility, they assumed  their proper form of mermen or merwomen, and began to lament in a mournful  lay, wildly accompanied by the storm that was raging around, the loss  of their sea-dress, which would prevent them from again enjoying their  native azure atmosphere, and coral mansions that lay below the deep  waters of the Atlantic.  But their chief lamentation was for Ollavitinus,  the son of Gioga, who, having been stripped of his seal’s skin,  would be for ever parted from his mates, and condemned to become an  outcast inhabitant of the upper world.  Their song was at length  broken off, by observing one of their enemies viewing, with shivering  limbs and looks of comfortless despair, the wild waves that dashed over  the stack.  Gioga immediately conceived the idea of rendering subservient  to the advantage of the son the perilous situation of the man.   She addressed him with  mildness, proposing to carry him safe on her back across the sea to  Papa Stour, on condition of receiving the seal-skin of Ollavitinus.   A bargain was struck, and Gioga clad herself in her amphibious garb;  but the Shetlander, alarmed at the sight of the stormy main that he  was to ride through, prudently begged leave of the matron, for his better  preservation, that he might be allowed to cut a few holes in her shoulders  and flanks, in order to procure, between the skin and the flesh, a better  fastening for his hands and feet.  The request being complied with,  the man grasped the neck of the seal, and committing himself to her  care, she landed him safely at Acres Gio in Papa Stour; from which place  he immediately repaired to a skeo at Hamna Voe, where the skin was deposited,  and honourably fulfilled his part of the contract, by affording Gioga  the means whereby her son could again revisit the ethereal space over  which the sea spread its green mantle.
