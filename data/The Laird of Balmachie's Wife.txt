Story Text:
In the olden times, when it was the fashion for gentlemen to wear  swords, the Laird of Balmachie went one day to Dundee, leaving his wife  at home ill in bed.  Riding home in the twilight, he had occasion  to leave the high road, and when crossing between some little romantic  knolls, called the Cur-hills, in the neighbourhood of Carlungy, he encountered  a troop of fairies supporting a kind of litter, upon which some person  seemed to be borne.  Being a man of dauntless courage, and, as  he said, impelled by some internal impulse, he pushed his horse close  to the litter, drew his sword, laid it across the vehicle, and in a  firm tone exclaimed—
“In the name of God, release your captive.”
The tiny troop immediately disappeared, dropping the litter on the  ground.  The laird dismounted, and found that it contained his  own wife, dressed in her bedclothes.  Wrapping his coat around  her, he placed her on the horse before him, and, having only  a short distance to ride, arrived safely at home.
Placing her in another room, under the care of an attentive friend,  he immediately went to the chamber where he had left his wife in the  morning, and there to all appearance she still lay, very sick of a fever.   She was fretful, discontented, and complained much of having been neglected  in his absence, at all of which the laird affected great concern, and  pretending much sympathy, insisted upon her rising to have her bed made.   She said that she was unable to rise, but her husband was peremptory,  and having ordered a large wood fire to warm the room, he lifted the  impostor from the bed, and bearing her across the floor as if to a chair,  which had been previously prepared, he threw her on the fire, from which  she bounced like a sky-rocket, and went through the ceiling, and out  at the roof of the house, leaving a hole among the slates.  He  then brought in his own wife, a little recovered from her alarm, who  said, that sometime after sunset, the nurse having left her for the  purpose of preparing a little candle, a multitude of elves came in at  the window, thronging like bees from a hive.  They filled the room,  and having lifted her from the bed carried her through the window, after  which she recollected nothing further, till she saw her husband standing  over her on the Cur-hills, at the back of Carlungy.   The hole in the roof, by which the female fairy made her escape, was  mended, but could never be kept in repair, as a tempest of wind happened  always once a year, which uncovered that particular spot, without injuring  any other part of the roof.
