Title: Notscha

None

Story Text:
The oldest daughter of the Ruler of Heaven had married the great general Li Dsing. Her sons were named Gintscha, Mutscha, and Notscha. But when Notscha was given her, she dreamed at night that a Taoist priest came into her chamber and said, “Swiftly receive the Heavenly Son!” And straightway a radiant pearl glowed within her. When Notscha came into the world, it seemed as though a ball of flesh were turning in circles like a wheel, and the whole room was filled with strange fragrances and a crimson light.
Li Dsing, though frightened, split the spinning sphere with his sword, and from it leapt a clever boy whose body glowed crimson, with a golden armlet and shimmering crimson silk. The boy’s brilliance and intelligence impressed his mother, and she loved him dearly.
When Notscha was seven years old, he ran away to cool off in the river. As he washed his crimson scarf, the castle of the Dragon-King trembled. After slaying a Triton and the Dragon-King’s son with his golden armlet and fiery silk, Notscha extracted a shimmering treasure—a dragon sinew—which he took proudly home, believing it to be a precious trophy.
The enraged Dragon-King complained to Li Dsing, but Notscha declared, “I brought this treasure for your armor, father!” His parents, weeping, could not protect him. But Notscha sought guidance from his master, the Great One. He blocked the dragon’s path to Heaven and defeated him again, tearing off scales as trophies and stuffing the trembling beast into his sleeve.
To avoid punishment, Notscha sacrificed himself to spare his parents. His soul drifted to his master’s cave, who instructed that a shrine be built on a green cliff. There, Notscha’s spirit accepted incense and prayers, performing miracles. Crowds gathered, and word spread of the clever god-child.
When Li Dsing discovered the shrine, enraged, he burned it down. Notscha returned to find his temple destroyed and, with the help of his master, received a new body made of lotus. This body was even more powerful, with fire and wind wheels on his feet, and magical treasures including a panther-skin pouch to store his sacred items.
Angry at his father, Notscha sought revenge, but his brothers, disciples of saints, defended Li Dsing. The great saint Wen Dschu defeated Notscha with a magical lotus and had him beaten. Only after intervention from the old Buddha of the Radiance of Light, who trapped him in a fiery pagoda, did Notscha swear to obey his father.
In later battles aiding King Wu of the Dschou dynasty, Notscha’s cleverness and supernatural weapons won many victories. Wounded once by a sorcerer, he drank heavenly wine and ate three fire-dates, gaining three heads and eight arms—one of the most treasured powers of all.
With his cleverness, magical treasure tools, and the guidance of the Great One, Notscha became one of the most revered divine warriors in the heavens.
