Story Text:
“Late one night, as my grand-uncle, Lachlan Dhu Macpherson,  who was well known as the best fiddler of his day, was returning home  from a ball, at which he had acted as a musician, he had occasion to  pass through the once-haunted Bog of Torrans.  Now, it happened  at that time that the bog was frequented by a huge bogle or ghost, who  was of a most mischievous disposition, and took particular pleasure  in abusing every traveller who had occasion to pass through the place  betwixt the twilight at night and cock-crowing in the morning.   Suspecting much that he would also come in for a share of his abuse,  my grand-uncle made up his mind, in the course of his progress, to return  the ghost any civilities which he might think meet to offer him.   On arriving on the spot, he found his suspicions were too well grounded;  for whom did he see but the ghost of Bogandoran apparently ready waiting  him, and seeming by his ghastly grin not a little overjoyed at the meeting.   Marching up to my grand-uncle,  the bogle clapped a huge club into his hand, and furnishing himself  with one of the same dimensions, he put a spittle in his hand, and deliberately  commenced the combat.  My grand-uncle returned the salute with  equal spirit, and so ably did both parties ply their batons that for  a while the issue of the combat was extremely doubtful.  At length,  however, the fiddler could easily discover that his opponent’s  vigour was much in the fagging order.  Picking up renewed courage  in consequence, he plied the ghost with renewed force, and after a stout  resistance, in the course of which both parties were seriously handled,  the ghost of Bogandoran thought it prudent to give up the night.
“At the same time, filled no doubt with great indignation at  this signal defeat, it seems the ghost resolved to re-engage my grand-uncle  on some other occasion, under more favourable circumstances.  Not  long after, as my grand-uncle was returning home quite unattended from  another ball in the Braes of the country, he had just entered the hollow  of Auldichoish, well known for its ‘eerie’ properties, when,  lo! who presented himself to his view on the adjacent eminence but his  old friend of Bogandoran, advancing as large as the gable of a house,  and putting himself in the most threatening and fighting attitudes.
“Looking at the very dangerous nature of the ground where they  had met, and feeling no anxiety for  a second encounter with a combatant of his weight, in a situation so  little desirable, the fiddler would have willingly deferred the settlement  of their differences till a more convenient season.  He, accordingly,  assuming the most submissive aspect in the world, endeavoured to pass  by his champion in peace, but in vain.  Longing, no doubt, to retrieve  the disgrace of his late discomfiture, the bogle instantly seized the  fiddler, and attempted with all his might to pull the latter down the  precipice, with the diabolical intention, it is supposed, of drowning  him in the river Avon below.  In this pious design the bogle was  happily frustrated by the intervention of some trees which grew on the  precipice, and to which my unhappy grand-uncle clung with the zeal of  a drowning man.  The enraged ghost, finding it impossible to extricate  him from those friendly trees, and resolving, at all events, to be revenged  upon him, fell upon maltreating the fiddler with his hands and feet  in the most inhuman manner.
“Such gross indignities my worthy grand-uncle was not accustomed  to, and being incensed beyond all measure at the liberties taken by  Bogandoran, he resolved again to try his mettle, whether life or death  should be the consequence.  Having no other weapon wherewith to  defend himself but his biodag, which, considering the nature  of his opponent’s constitution, he suspected much would be of  little avail to him—I  say, in the absence of any other weapon, he sheathed the biodag three times in the ghost of Bogandoran’s body.  And what  was the consequence?  Why, to the great astonishment of my courageous  forefather, the ghost fell down cold dead at his feet, and was never  more seen or heard of.”
