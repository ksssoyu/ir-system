Story Text:
It is a point of faith accepted by all devout  Portuguese that thirty-three baths in the  sea must be taken on or before the 24th of  August of every year. Although the motive  may not seem to be very reasonable, still the  result is of great advantage to those believers  who occupy thirty-three days in taking the  thirty-three baths, for otherwise the majority  of them would never undergo any form of  ablution.
That the demon is loose on the 24th of  August is an established fact among the credulous;  and were it not for the compact entered  into between St. Bartholomew and the said  demon, that all who have taken thirty-three  baths during the year should be free from his  talons, the list of the condemned would be  much increased.
Now, there was a very powerful baron, whose castle was erected on the eastern slope of the  Gaviarra, overlooking the neighbouring provinces  of Spain, and he had always refused to  take these thirty-three baths, for he maintained  that it was cowardly on the part of a man  to show any fear of the demon. His castle  was fully manned; the drawbridge was never  left lowered; the turrets were never left unguarded;  and a wide and deep ditch surrounded  the whole of his estates, which had been given  him by Affonso Henriques, after the complete  overthrow of the Saracens at Ourique, in  which famous and decisive battle the baron had  wrought wondrous deeds of bravery.
All round the castle were planted numerous  vines, which had been brought from Burgundy  by order of Count Henry, father of the first  Portuguese king; and in the month of August  the grapes are already well formed, but the  hand of Nature has not yet painted them.  Among the vines quantities of yellow melons  and green water-melons were strewn over the  ground, while the mottled pumpkins hung gracefully  from the branches of the orange-trees.
In front of the castle was an arbour, formed  of box-trees, under which a lovely fountain had  been constructed; and here, in the hot summer months, would wander the baron’s only  daughter, Alina. She was possessed of all  the qualities, mental and physical, which went  towards making the daughter of a feudal lord  desired in marriage by all the gallants of the  day; and as she was heiress to large estates,  these would have been considered a sufficient  prize without the said qualities. But Alina, for  all this, was not happy, for she was enamoured of  a handsome chief, who, unfortunately, wore the  distinctive almexia, which proved him to be  a Moor, and, consequently, not a fit suitor for  the daughter of a Christian baron.
“My father,” she would often soliloquize, “is  kind to me, and professes to be a Christian.  My lover, as a follower of the Prophet, hates  my father, but, as a man, he loves me. For  me he says he will do anything; yet, when I  ask him to become a Christian, he answers me  that he will do so if I can prevail on my father  to so far conform with the Christian law as to  take the thirty-three baths; and this my father  will not do. What am I to do? He would  rather fight the demon than obey the saint.”
One day, however, she resolved on telling  her father about her courtship with the young  chief, Al-Muli, and of the only condition he made, on which depended his becoming a  convert to Christianity, which so infuriated the  baron that, in his anger, he declared himself  willing to meet the demon in mortal combat,  hoping thus to free the world of him and of  the necessity of taking the thirty-three baths.
This so much distressed Alina, that when,  during the afternoon of the same day, Al-Muli  met her in the arbour, she disclosed to him her  firm resolution of entering a convent, and  spending the rest of her days there.
“This shall not be!” cried Al-Muli; and,  seizing her round the waist, he lifted her on to  his shoulder, sped through the baronial grounds,  and, having waded through the ditch, placed  her on the albarda of his horse and galloped  away.
Alina was so frightened that she could not  scream, and she silently resigned herself to her  fate, trusting in the honour of her lover.
The alcazar, or palace, of Al-Muli was  situated on the Spanish side of the frontier;  and, as they approached the principal gate, the  almocadem, or captain of the guard, hurried to  receive his master, who instructed him to send  word to his mother that he desired of her to  receive and look after Alina. This done, he assisted his bride elect to dismount, and, with  a veil hiding her lovely features, she was ushered  by Al-Muli’s mother into a magnificently  furnished room, and took a seat on a richly  embroidered cushion, called an almofada.
To her future mother-in-law she related all  that referred to her conversation with her  father, and how she had been brought away  from his castle; and she further said that she  very much feared the baron would summon all  his numerous followers to rescue her.
Al-Muli’s mother was a descendant of the  Moors who first landed at Algeziras, and from  them had descended to her that knowledge of  the black art which has been peculiar to that  race. She, therefore, replied that although she  could count on the resistance her almogavares,  or garrison soldiers, would offer to the forces  of the baron, still she would do her utmost  to avoid a conflict. She then proceeded to  another room, in which she kept her magic  mirror, and having closed the door, we must  leave her consulting the oracle.
The baron was not long in discovering the  absence of his daughter, and he so stormed  about the place that his servants were afraid to  come near him.
In a short time, however, his reason seemed  to return to him, and he sat down on his old  chair and gave way to grief when he saw that  his Alina’s cushion was vacant.
“My child—my only child and love,” sobbed  the old man, “thou hast left thy father’s  castle, and gone with the accursed Moor into  the hostile land of Spain. Oh, that I had  been a good Christian, and looked after my  daughter better! I have braved the orders of  good St. Bartholomew; I would not take the  thirty-three baths in the sea, and now I am  wretched!”
The baron suddenly became aware of the  presence of a distinguished and patriarchal  looking stranger, who addressed him thus—
“You mortals only think of St. Barbara  when it thunders. Now that the storm of  sorrow has burst on you, you reproach yourself  for not having thought of me and of my instructions.  But I see that you are penitent, and  if you will do as I tell you, you will regain  your daughter.”
It was St. Bartholomew himself who was  speaking, and the baron, for the first time in  his life, shook in his shoes with fear and shame.
“Reverend saint,” at last ejaculated the baron, “help me in this my hour of need, and I will  promise you anything—and, what is more, I  will keep my promises.”
“And you had better do so,” continued the  saint; “for not even Satan has dared to break  his compact with me. You don’t know how  terrible I can be!”—here the saint raised his  voice to such a pitch that the castle shook.  “Only let me catch you playing false with me,  and I’ll—I’ll—I don’t know what I’ll do!”
“Most reverend saint and father, you have  only to command me and I will obey,” murmured  the affrighted baron—“I will indeed.  Good venerable St. Bartholomew, only give me  back my daughter—that is all I ask.”
“Your daughter is now in the hands of  Al-Muli, her lover, who dwells in a stronger  castle than yours, and who, moreover, has a  mother versed in the black art. It is no good  your trying to regain her by the force at your  disposal; you must rely on me—only on me.  Do you understand?” asked the saint.
“Yes, dear, good, noble, and venerable saint,  I do understand you; but what am I to do?”
“Simply follow me, and say not a word as  you go,” commanded the patriarch.
The baron did as he was told; and out from the castle the two went unseen by any one.  The baron soon perceived that he was hurrying  through the air, and he was so afraid of falling  that he closed his eyes. All at once he felt  that his feet were touching the ground; and,  looking around him, what was his delight  to find himself close to his dear daughter  Alina.
“Father—dear father!” exclaimed Alina;  “how did you come here so quickly, for I  have only just arrived? And how did you  pass by the guards?”
The baron was going to tell her, but the  saint, in a whisper, enjoined silence on this  point; and the baron now noticed that the  saint was invisible.
“Never mind, dear child, how I came here;  it is enough that I am here,” replied her father.  “And I intend taking you home with me, dear  Alina. The castle is so lonely without you;”  and the old man sobbed.
At this moment Al-muli entered the chamber,  and, seeing Alina’s father there, he thought  there had been treachery among his guards; so  striking a gong that was near him, a number of  armed men rushed in.
“How now, traitors!” said he. “How have you been careful of your duties when you have  allowed this stranger to enter unobserved?”
The soldiers protested their innocence, until  at last Al-muli commenced to think that there  must be some secret entrance into his castle.
“Search everywhere!” screamed the infuriated  Moor. “Have the guard doubled at all  the entrances, and send me up the captain!”
Al-muli’s instructions were carried out, and  the captain reported that all was safe.
“Old man,” said the Moor, addressing the  baron, “I have thee now in my power. Thou  wert the enemy of my noble race. To thy blind  rage my predecessors owed their downfall in  Portugal. Thy bitter hatred carried thee to  acts of vengeance. Thou art now in my power,  but I will not harm one of thy grey hairs.”
“Moor,” replied the baron, with a proud  look, “can the waters of the Manzanares and  of the Guadalquivir join? No! And so cannot  and may not thy accursed race join with  ours! Thy race conquered our people, and in  rising against thine we did but despoil the  despoiler.”
“Thy logic is as baseless as thy fury was  wont to be,” answered the Moor. “Though  hundreds of miles separate the Manzanares from the Guadalquivir, yet do they meet in the  mightier waters of the ocean. Hadst thou said  that ignorance cannot join hands with learning,  thou wouldst have been nearer the mark, or  that the Cross can never dim the light of the  Crescent.”
These words were spoken in a haughty  manner; and as Al-muli turned round and  looked upon his splendidly arrayed soldiers,  who surrounded the chamber, his pride seemed  justified.
“Thou canst not crush me more than thou  hast done, vile Moor,” said the baron. “Thou  hast robbed me of my daughter, not by force of  arms, but stealthily, as a thief at midnight. If  any spark of chivalry warmed thy infidel blood  thou wouldst blush for the act thou hast  wrought. But I fear thee not, proud Moor; thy  warriors are no braver than thy women. Dare  them to move, and I will lay thee at my feet.”
“Oh, my father, and thou, dear Al-Muli,  abandon these threats, even if you cannot be  friends.”
“No, maiden,” exclaimed Al-Muli; “I will  not be bearded in my own den. Advance,  guards, and take this old man to a place of  safety below!”
But not a soldier moved; and when Al-Muli  was about to approach them to see what was  the matter with them, his scimitar dropped from  his hand, and he fell on the ground.
“What charm hast thou brought to bear on  me, bold baron,” screamed the Moor, “that I  am thus rendered powerless? Alina, if thou  lovest me, give me but that goblet full of water,  for I am faint.”
Alina would have done as her lover bade  her, but just then the figure of the venerable  St. Bartholomew was seen with the cross in his  right hand.
“Moor and infidel,” said the saint, “thou  hast mocked at this symbol of Christianity,  and thou hast done grievous injury to this  Christian baron; but thou hast been conscientious  in thy infidelity. Nor am I slow to  recognize in thy race a knowledge of the arts  and sciences not yet extended to the Christian.  Yet, for all this, thou art but an infidel. Let  me but baptize thee with the water thou  wouldst have drunk, and all will yet be  well.”
“No, sir saint,” answered the Moor. “When  in my castle strangers thus treat me rudely, I  can die, but not bend to their orders. If yonder baron is a true Christian, why has he not taken  the thirty-three baths enjoined by thee?”
“And if my father do take them, wilt thou,  as thou didst promise me,” said Alina, “be  converted to the true faith?”
“The Moor breaks not his promise. As the  golondrina returns to its nest in due season, so  the man of honour returns to his promise.”  Then, turning to the baron, he demanded to  know if he would comply with the saint’s  instructions.
“Yes,” answered the baron; “I have promised  the good saint everything, and I will fulfil my  promises. Al-Muli, if you love my daughter,  love her faith also, and I will then have  regained not only a daughter, but a son in my  old age.”
“The promise of the Moor is sacred,” said  Al-Muli. “Baptize me and my household;  and do thou, good baron, intercede for me with  the venerable saint, for I like not this lowly  posture.”
“My dear Al-Muli,” sobbed Alina for joy,  “the Cross and the Crescent are thus united in  the mightier ocean of love and goodwill. May  the two races whom one God has made be  reconciled! And to-morrow’s sun must not set before we all comply with the condition imposed  by St. Bartholomew.”
The saint was rejoiced with the work he had  that day done, and declared that the churches  he liked men to construct are those built within  them, where the incense offered is prayer, and  the work done, love. “As for the baths, they  are but desirable auxiliaries,” said he.
