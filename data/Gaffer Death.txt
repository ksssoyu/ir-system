Story Text:
There was once a poor man who had twelve children,  and he was obliged to labour day and night  that he might earn food for them. When at length,  as it so happened, a thirteenth came into the world,  the poor man did not know how to help himself,  so he ran out into the highway, determined to  ask the first person he met to be godfather to the  boy.
There came stalking up to him Death, who said—
"Take me for a godfather."
"Who are you?" asked the father.
"I am Death, who makes all equal," replied the  stranger.
Then said the man—
"You are one of the right sort: you seize on rich  and poor without distinction; you shall be the child's  godfather."
Death answered—
"I will make the boy rich and renowned throughout  the world, for he who has me for a friend can  want nothing."
Said the man—
"Next Sunday will he be christened, mind and  come at the right time."
Death accordingly appeared as he had promised,  and stood godfather to the child.
When the boy grew up his godfather came to  him one day, and took him into a wood, and  said—
"Now shall you have your godfather's present. I  will make a most famous physician of you. Whenever  you are called to a sick person, I will take care  and show myself to you. If I stand at the foot of  the bed, say boldly, 'I will soon restore you to  health,' and give the patient a little herb that I will  point out to you, and he will soon be well. If,  however, I stand at the head of the sick person, he  is mine; then say, 'All help is useless; he must  soon die.'"
Then Death showed him the little herb, and  said—
"Take heed that you never use it in opposition  to my will."
It was not long before the young fellow was the  most celebrated physician in the whole world.
"The moment he sees a person," said every one,  "he knows whether or not he'll recover."
Accordingly he was soon in great request. People  came from far and near to consult him, and they  gave him whatever he required, so that he made an  immense fortune. Now, it so happened that the  king was taken ill, and the physician was called  upon to say whether he must die. As he went up  to the bed he saw Death standing at the sick  man's head, so that there was no chance of his  recovery. The physician thought, however, that if  he outwitted Death, he would not, perhaps, be much  offended, seeing that he was his godfather, so he  caught hold of the king and turned him round, so  that by that means Death was standing at his feet.  Then he gave him some of the herb, and the king  recovered, and was once more well. Death came  up to the physician with a very angry and gloomy  countenance, and said—
"I will forgive you this time what you have done,  because I am your godfather, but if you ever venture  to betray me again, you must take the consequences."
Soon after this the king's daughter fell sick, and  nobody could cure her. The old king wept night  and day, until his eyes were blinded, and at last  he proclaimed that whosoever rescued her from  Death should be rewarded by marrying her and  inheriting his throne. The physician came, but  Death was standing at the head of the princess.  When the physician saw the beauty of the king's  daughter, and thought of the promises that the king  had made, he forgot all the warnings he had received,  and, although Death frowned heavily all the while,  he turned the patient so that Death stood at her  feet, and gave her some of the herb, so that he once  more put life into her veins.
When Death saw that he was a second time  cheated out of his property, he stepped up to the  physician, and said—
"Now, follow me."
He laid hold of him with his icy cold hand, and  led him into a subterranean cave, in which there  were thousands and thousands of burning candles,  ranged in innumerable rows. Some were whole,  some half burnt out, some nearly consumed. Every  instant some went out, and fresh ones were lighted,  so that the little flames seemed perpetually hopping  about.
"Behold," said Death, "the life-candles of mankind.  The large ones belong to children, those half  consumed to middle-aged people, the little ones to  the aged. Yet children and young people have  oftentimes but a little candle, and when that is  burnt out, their life is at an end, and they are mine."
The physician said—
"Show me my candle."
Then Death pointed out a very little candle-end,  which was glimmering in the socket, and said—
"Behold!"
Then the physician said—
"O dearest godfather, light me up a new one,  that I may first enjoy my life, be king, and husband  of the beautiful princess."
"I cannot do so," said Death; "one must burn out  before I can light up another."
"Place the old one then upon a new one, that  that may burn on when this is at an end," said the  physician.
Death pretended that he would comply with this  wish, and reached a large candle, but to revenge  himself, purposely failed in putting it up, and the  little piece fell and was extinguished. The physician  sank with it, so he himself fell into the hands of  Death.
