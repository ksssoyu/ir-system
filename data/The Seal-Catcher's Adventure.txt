Story Text:
There was once upon a time a man who lived upon the northern coasts,  not far from “Taigh Jan Crot Callow” (John-o’-Groat’s  House), and he gained his livelihood by catching and killing fish, of  all sizes and denominations.  He had a particular liking for the  killing of those wonderful beasts, half dog half fish, called “Roane,”  or seals, no doubt because he got a long price for their skins, which  are not less curious than they are valuable.  The truth is, that  the most of these animals are neither dogs nor cods, but downright fairies,  as this narration will show; and, indeed, it is easy for any man to  convince himself of the fact by a simple examination of his tobacco-spluichdan,  for the dead skins of those beings are never the same for four-and-twenty  hours together.  Sometimes the spluichdan will erect its  bristles almost perpendicularly, while, at other times, it reclines  them even down; one time it resembles a bristly sow, at another time  a sleekit cat; and what dead skin, except itself, could perform  such cantrips?  Now, it happened one day, as this notable  fisher had returned from the prosecution of his calling, that he was  called upon by a man who seemed a great stranger, and who said he had  been despatched for him by a person who wished to contract for a quantity  of seal-skins, and that the fisher must accompany him (the stranger)  immediately to see the person who wished to contract for the skins,  as it was necessary that he should be served that evening.  Happy  in the prospect of making a good bargain, and never suspecting any duplicity,  he instantly complied.  They both mounted a steed belonging to  the stranger, and took the road with such velocity that, although the  direction of the wind was towards their backs, yet the fleetness of  their movement made it appear as if it had been in their faces.   On reaching a stupendous precipice which overhung the sea, his guide  told him they had now reached their destination.
“Where is the person you spoke of!” inquired the astonished  seal-killer.
“You shall see that presently,” replied the guide.   With that they immediately alighted, and, without allowing the seal-killer  much time to indulge the frightful suspicions that began to pervade  his mind, the stranger seized him with irresistible force, and plunged  headlong with him into the sea.  After sinking down, down, nobody  knows how far, they at length reached a door, which, being open, led  them into a range of apartments, filled with inhabitants—not people,  but seals, who could nevertheless speak and feel like human folk; and  how much was the seal-killer surprised to find that he himself had been  unconsciously transformed into the like image.  If it were not  so, he would probably have died from the want of breath.  The nature  of the poor fisher’s thoughts may be more easily conceived than  described.  Looking at the nature of the quarters into which he  had landed, all hopes of escape from them appeared wholly chimerical,  whilst the degree of comfort, and length of life which the barren scene  promised him were far from being flattering.  The “Roane,”  who all seemed in very low spirits, appeared to feel for him, and endeavoured  to soothe the distress which he evinced by the amplest assurances of  personal safety.  Involved in sad meditation on his evil fate,  he was quickly roused from his stupor by his guide’s producing  a huge gully or joctaleg, the object of which he supposed was to put  an end to all his earthly cares.  Forlorn as was his situation,  however, he did not wish to be killed; and, apprehending instant destruction,  he fell down, and earnestly implored for mercy.  The poor generous  animals did not mean him any harm, however much his former conduct deserved  it, and he was accordingly desired to pacify himself, and cease his  cries.
“Did you ever see that knife before?” said the stranger  to the fisher.
The latter instantly  recognised his own knife, which he had that day stuck into a seal, and  with which it had escaped, and acknowledged it was formerly his own,  for what would be the use of denying it?
“Well,” rejoined the guide, “the apparent seal  which made away with it is my father, who has lain dangerously ill ever  since, and no means can stay his fleeting breath without your aid.   I have been obliged to resort to the artifice I have practised to bring  you hither, and I trust that my filial duty to my father will readily  excuse me.”
Having said this, he led into another apartment the trembling seal-killer,  who expected every minute to be punished for his own ill-treatment of  the father.  There he found the identical seal with which he had  had the encounter in the morning, suffering most grievously from a tremendous  cut in its hind-quarter.  The seal-killer was then desired, with  his hand, to cicatrise the wound, upon doing which it immediately healed,  and the seal arose from its bed in perfect health.  Upon this the  scene changed from mourning to rejoicing—all was mirth and glee.   Very different, however, were the feelings of the unfortunate seal-catcher,  who expected no doubt to be metamorphosed into a seal for the remainder  of his life.  However, his late guide accosting him, said—
“Now, sir, you are at liberty to return to your wife  and family, to whom I am about to conduct you; but it is on this express  condition, to which you must bind yourself by a solemn oath, viz. that  you will never maim or kill a seal in all your lifetime hereafter.”
To this condition, hard as it was, he joyfully acceded; and the oath  being administered in all due form, he bade his new acquaintance most  heartily and sincerely a long farewell.  Taking hold of his guide,  they issued from the place and swam up, till they regained the surface  of the sea, and, landing at the said stupendous pinnacle, they found  their former steed ready for a second canter.  The guide breathed  upon the fisher, and they became like men.  They mounted their  horse, and fleet as had been their course towards the precipice, their  return from it was doubly swift; and the honest seal-killer was laid  down at his own door-cheek, where his guide made him such a present  as would have almost reconciled him to another similar expedition, such  as rendered his loss of profession, in so far as regarded the seals,  a far less intolerable hardship than he had at first considered it.
