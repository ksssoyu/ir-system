Story Text:
Once upon a time a tenant in the neighbourhood of Cairngorm, in Strathspey,  emigrated with his family and cattle to the forest of Glenavon, which  is well known to be inhabited by many fairies as well as ghosts.   Two of his sons being out late one night in search of some of their  sheep which had strayed, had occasion to pass a fairy turret, or dwelling,  of very large dimensions; and what was their astonishment on observing  streams of the most refulgent light shining forth through innumerable  crevices in the rock—crevices which the sharpest eye in the country  had never seen before.  Curiosity led them towards the turret,  when they were charmed by the most exquisite sounds ever emitted by  a fiddle-string, which, joined to the sportive mirth and glee accompanying  it, reconciled them in a great measure to the scene, although they knew  well enough the inhabitants of the nook were fairies.  Nay, overpowered  by the enchanting jigs played by the fiddler, one of the brothers had  even the hardihood to propose that they should pay the occupants of  the turret a short  visit.  To this motion the other brother, fond as he was of dancing,  and animated as he was by the music, would by no means consent, and  he earnestly desired his brother to restrain his curiosity.  But  every new jig that was played, and every new reel that was danced, inspired  the adventurous brother with additional ardour, and at length, completely  fascinated by the enchanting revelry, leaving all prudence behind, at  one leap he entered the “Shian.”  The poor forlorn  brother was now left in a most uncomfortable situation.  His grief  for the loss of a brother whom he dearly loved suggested to him more  than once the desperate idea of sharing his fate by following his example.   But, on the other hand, when he coolly considered the possibility of  sharing very different entertainment from that which rang upon his ears,  and remembered, too, the comforts and convenience of his father’s  fireside, the idea immediately appeared to him anything but prudent.   After a long and disagreeable altercation between his affection for  his brother and his regard for himself, he came to the resolution to  take a middle course, that is, to shout in at the window a few remonstrances  to his brother, which, if he did not attend to, let the consequences  be upon his own head.  Accordingly, taking his station at one of  the crevices, and calling upon his brother three several times by name,  as use is, he uttered the most moving pieces of elocution he could think  of, imploring him, as he valued his poor parents’ life and blessing,  to come forth and go home with him, Donald Macgillivray, his thrice  affectionate and unhappy brother.  But whether it was the dancer  could not hear this eloquent harangue, or, what is more probable, that  he did not choose to attend to it, certain it is that it proved totally  ineffectual to accomplish its object, and the consequence was that Donald  Macgillivray found it equally his duty and his interest to return home  to his family with the melancholy tale of poor Rory’s fate.   All the prescribed ceremonies calculated to rescue him from the fairy  dominion were resorted to by his mourning relatives without effect,  and Rory was supposed lost for ever, when a “wise man” of  the day having learned the circumstance, discovered to his friends a  plan by which they might deliver him at the end of twelve months from  his entry.
“Return,” says the Duin Glichd to Donald, “to  the place where you lost your brother a year and a day from the time.   You will insert in your garment a Rowan Cross, which will protect  you from the fairies’ interposition.  Enter the turret boldly  and resolutely in the name of the Highest, claim your brother, and,  if he does not accompany you voluntarily, seize him and carry him off  by force—none dare interfere with you.”
The experiment appeared to the cautious contemplative brother  as one that was fraught with no ordinary danger, and he would have most  willingly declined the prominent character allotted to him in the performance  but for the importunate entreaty of his friends, who implored him, as  he valued their blessing, not to slight such excellent advice.   Their entreaties, together with his confidence in the virtues of the Rowan Cross, overcame his scruples, and he at length agreed to  put the experiment in practice, whatever the result might be.
Well, then, the important day arrived, when the father of the two  sons was destined either to recover his lost son, or to lose the only  son he had, and, anxious as the father felt, Donald Macgillivray, the  intended adventurer, felt no less so on the occasion.  The hour  of midnight approached when the drama was to be acted, and Donald Macgillivray,  loaded with all the charms and benedictions in his country, took mournful  leave of his friends, and proceeded to the scene of his intended enterprise.   On approaching the well-known turret, a repetition of that mirth and  those ravishing sounds, that had been the source of so much sorrow to  himself and family, once more attracted his attention, without at all  creating in his mind any extraordinary feelings of satisfaction.   On the contrary, he abhorred the sounds most heartily, and felt much  greater inclination to recede than to advance.  But what was to  be done?  Courage, character, and everything dear to  him were at stake, so that to advance was his only alternative.   In short, he reached the “Shian,” and, after twenty fruitless  attempts, he at length entered the place with trembling footsteps, and  amidst the brilliant and jovial scene the not least gratifying spectacle  which presented itself to Donald was his brother Rory earnestly engaged  at the Highland fling on the floor, at which, as might have been expected,  he had greatly improved.  Without losing much time in satisfying  his curiosity by examining the quality of the company, Donald ran to  his brother, repeating, most vehemently, the words prescribed to him  by the “wise man,” seized him by the collar, and insisted  on his immediately accompanying him home to his poor afflicted parents.   Rory assented, provided he would allow him to finish his single reel,  assuring Donald, very earnestly, that he had not been half an hour in  the house.  In vain did the latter assure him that, instead of  half an hour, he had actually remained twelve months.  Nor would  he have believed his overjoyed friends when his brother at length got  him home, did not the calves, now grown into stots, and the new-born  babes, now travelling the house, at length convince him that in his  single reel he had danced for a twelvemonth and a day.
