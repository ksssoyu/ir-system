## Introduction
The Folktale & Fairy Tale IR System is a specialized information retrieval (IR) system designed for efficiently searching and retrieving folktales and fairy tales based on titles, summaries, full text, and book metadata.

The source texts for this IR system have been collected from World of Tales (https://www.worldoftales.com/), specifically from a diverse selection of Andrew Lang's fairy tales, Grimm's fairy tales, and various folktales from African, Asian, European, and American traditions.
