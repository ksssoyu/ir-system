# Fairy Tale & Folktale Information Retrieval System

This system has been developed as part of an assignment for the Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval course at Chung-Ang University.

## Introduction
The **Fairy Tale & Folktale IR System** is a specialized information retrieval (IR) system designed for efficiently searching and retrieving fairy tales and folktales based on titles, summaries, full text, and book metadata.

This project was inspired by my personal interest in **reading English fairy tales and folktales** as a way to improve my language skills. When selecting a topic for this assignment, I was encouraged to choose a domain based on my own interests. Since I had already been exploring fairy tales and folktales, I thought it would be useful to create a system that allows users to **easily search for and retrieve these stories based on specific conditions**. This system aims to provide an efficient and structured way for users to navigate a diverse collection of folklore.

The source texts for this IR system have been collected from **World of Tales** (ðŸ“– Source: https://www.worldoftales.com/), specifically from a diverse selection of **Andrew Lang's fairy tales, Grimm's fairy tales, and various folktales from African, Asian, European, and American traditions**.
